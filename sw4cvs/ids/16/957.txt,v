*Abstract
We study the performance of ant routing for static and
dynamic network topologies. We also compare the performance
of ant routing with AODV and DSR for ad hoc
networks. The simulations show that the ant routing algorithm
performs well for static topologies. However, the
routing overhead in ant routing is more than AODV and
DSR. Therefore, ant routing performs worse than AODV
and DSR in ad hoc networks because of the limited capacity
and restrictions on the buffer size. Moreover, with mobility,
a large number of data packets in ant routing experience
loops that degrade the end-to-end performance.
