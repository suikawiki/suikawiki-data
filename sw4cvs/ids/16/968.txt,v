*Abstract
This paper introduces AntNet, a novel approach to the adaptive learning of routing
tables in communications networks. AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte
Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving
optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange
collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous,
mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects
and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning elds. The algorithms'
performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over
real and articial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal trac distributions. Results are very encouraging.
AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect
to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain
the reasons for its superiority.
