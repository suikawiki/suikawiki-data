*Abstract

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is comprised of mobile hosts that can communicate with each other using wireless links. In this paper we present a novel routing algorithm called GPSAL (GPS/Ant-Like Routing Algorithm) which is based on GPS (Global Positioning System) and mobile software agents modeled on ants for routing in ad hoc networks. We compare our algorithm to the Location-Aided Routing (LAR) [20] algorithm for MANET which is also based on GPS. Simulation results show that our algorithm has less overhead than LAR.

Ant-like agents or the so-called mobile software agents were used by Appleby and
Steward [1] for network control in telecommunications. Schoonderwoerd et al. [29] improved
on the work of Appleby and Steward [1] by using simple agents that modify the
routing tables of every node in a given network. Bonabeau et al. [4] proposed a simple
mechanism based on ant-like agents for routing and load balancing in telecommunications
based on the previous works of [1,29]. The results presented in [1,4,29] are very
promising and the same principle is used in this paper.
