@Biologically Inspired Models for Sensor Network Design

!Abstract

This paper discusses the purposes, requirements and challenges of creating pervasive
networks of devices that have sensor technology and embedded computation. The
demands placed on these sensor networks suggest that they have to function in a similar
way to self-organised biological systems so concepts can be taken from them to design
appropriate models for how sensor networks could work. This paper focuses on the
reasons why this is possible and gives examples of previously studied biological systems.
