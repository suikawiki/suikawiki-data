*Abstract

Many animals use chemical substances known as pheromones
to induce behavioural changes in other members of the same species. The
use of pheromones by ants in particular has lead to the development of
a number of computational analogues of ant colony behaviour including
Ant Colony Optimisation. Although many animals use a range of
pheromones in their communication, ant algorithms have typically focused
on the use of just one, a substance that encourages succeeding
generations of (artificial) ants to follow the same path as previous generations.
Ant algorithms for multi-objective optimisation and those employing
multiple colonies have made use of more than one pheromone, but
the interactions between these different pheromones are largely simple
extensions of single criterion, single colony ant algorithms. This paper
investigates an alternative form of interaction between normal pheromone
and anti-pheromone. Three variations of Ant Colony System that
apply the anti-pheromone concept in different ways are described and
tested against benchmark travelling salesman problems. The results indicate
that the use of anti-pheromone can lead to improved performance.
However, if anti-pheromone is allowed too great an influence on ants’ decisions,
poorer performance may result.
