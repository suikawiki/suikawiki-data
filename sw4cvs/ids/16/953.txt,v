*Abstract

In ant societies, and, more in general, in insect societies, the activities of the individuals, as well
as of the society as a whole, are not regulated by any explicit form of centralized control. On the
other hand, adaptive and robust behaviors transcending the behavioral repertoire of the single
individual can be easily observed at society level. These complex global behaviors are the result
of self-organizing dynamics driven by local interactions and communications among a number
of relatively simple individuals. The simultaneous presence of these and other fascinating and
unique characteristics have made ant societies an attractive and inspiring model for building
new algorithms and new multi-agent systems. In the last decade, ant societies have been taken as a
reference for an ever growing body of scientic work, mostly in the elds of robotics, operations
research, and telecommunications.

Among the different works inspired by ant colonies, the Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic
(ACO) is probably the most successful and popular one. The ACO metaheuristic is a multi-agent
framework for combinatorial optimization whose main components are: a set of ant-like agents,
the use of memory and of stochastic decisions, and strategies of collective and distributed learning.
It finds its roots in the experimental observation of a specic foraging behavior of some ant
colonies that, under appropriate conditions, are able to select the shortest path among few possible
paths connecting their nest to a food site. The pheromone, a volatile chemical substance laid
on the ground by the ants while walking and affecting in turn their moving decisions according
to its local intensity, is the mediator of this behavior. All the elements playing an essential role
in the ant colony foraging behavior were understood, thoroughly reverse-engineered and put
to work to solve problems of combinatorial optimization by Marco Dorigo and his co-workers
at the beginning of the 1990's. From that moment on it has been a ourishing of new combinatorial
optimization algorithms designed after the rst algorithms of Dorigo's et al., and of
related scientic events. In 1999 the ACO metaheuristic was dened by Dorigo, Di Caro and
Gambardella with the purpose of providing a common framework for describing and analyzing
all these algorithms inspired by the same ant colony behavior and by the same common process
of reverse-engineering of this behavior. Therefore, the ACO metaheuristic was dened a posteriori,
as the result of a synthesis effort effectuated on the study of the characteristics of all these
ant-inspired algorithms and on the abstraction of their common traits. The ACO's synthesis
was also motivated by the usually good performance shown by the algorithms (e.g., for several
important combinatorial problems like the quadratic assignment, vehicle routing and job shop
scheduling, ACO implementations have outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms).
The denition and study of the ACO metaheuristic is one of the two fundamental goals of the
thesis. The other one, strictly related to this former one, consists in the design, implementation,
and testing of ACO instances for problems of adaptive routing in telecommunication networks.
{{category ACO}}

This thesis is an in-depth journey through the ACO metaheuristic, during which we have
(re)dened ACO and tried to get a clear understanding of its potentialities, limits, and relationships
with other frameworks and with its biological background. The thesis takes into account
all the developments that have followed the original 1999's denition, and provides a formal and
comprehensive systematization of the subject, as well as an up-to-date and quite comprehensive
review of current applications. We have also identied in dynamic problems in telecommunication
networks the most appropriate domain of application for the ACO ideas. According to
this understanding, in the most applicative part of the thesis we have focused on problems of
adaptive routing in networks and we have developed and tested four new algorithms.

Adopting an original point of view with respect to the way ACO was rstly dened (but
maintaining full conceptual and terminological consistency), ACO is here dened and mainly
discussed in the terms of sequential decision processes and Monte Carlo sampling and learning. More
precisely, ACO is characterized as a policy search strategy aimed at learning the distributed parameters
(called pheromone variables in accordance with the biological metaphor) of the stochastic
decision policy which is used by so-called ant agents to generate solutions. Each ant represents
in practice an independent sequential decision process aimed at constructing a possibly feasible solution
for the optimization problem at hand by using only information local to the decision step.

Ants are repeatedly and concurrently generated in order to sample the solution set according to the
current policy. The outcomes of the generated solutions are used to partially evaluate the current
policy, spot the most promising search areas, and update the policy parameters in order to possibly
focus the search in those promising areas while keeping a satisfactory level of overall exploration.

This way of looking at ACO has facilitated to disclose the strict relationships between ACO
and other well-known frameworks, like dynamic programming, Markov and non-Markov decision
processes, and reinforcement learning. In turn, this has favored reasoning on the general properties
of ACO in terms of amount of complete state information which is used by the ACO's ants to take
optimized decisions and to encode in pheromone variables memory of both the decisions that
belonged to the sampled solutions and their quality.

The ACO's biological context of inspiration is fully acknowledged in the thesis. We report
with extensive discussions on the shortest path behaviors of ant colonies and on the identi-
cation and analysis of the few nonlinear dynamics that are at the very core of self-organized
behaviors in both the ants and other societal organizations. We discuss these dynamics in the
general framework of stigmergic modeling, based on asynchronous environment-mediated communication
protocols, and (pheromone) variables priming coordinated responses of a number
of &#147;cheap&#148; and concurrent agents.

The second half of the thesis is devoted to the study of the application of ACO to problems
of online routing in telecommunication networks. This class of problems has been identied in the
thesis as the most appropriate for the application of the multi-agent, distributed, and adaptive
nature of the ACO architecture. Four novel ACO algorithms for problems of adaptive routing in
telecommunication networks are throughly described. The four algorithms cover a wide spectrum
of possible types of network: two of them deliver best-effort trafc in wired IP networks, one
is intended for quality-of-service (QoS) trafc in ATM networks, and the fourth is for best-effort traf-
c in mobile ad hoc networks. The two algorithms for wired IP networks have been extensively
tested by simulation studies and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for a wide set of reference
scenarios. The algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks is still under development, but quite
extensive results and comparisons with a popular state-of-the-art algorithm are reported. No
results are reported for the algorithm for QoS, which has not been fully tested. 
{{category Ant Routing}}

The observed experimental
performance is excellent, especially for the case of wired IP networks: our algorithms
always perform comparably or much better than the state-of-the-art competitors. 

In the thesis
we try to understand the rationale behind the brilliant performance obtained and the good level
of popularity reached by our algorithms. More in general, we discuss the reasons of the general
efcacy of the ACO approach for network routing problems compared to the characteristics of
more classical approaches. Moving further, we also informally dene Ant Colony Routing (ACR),
a multi-agent framework explicitly integrating learning components into the ACO's design in
order to dene a general and in a sense futuristic architecture for autonomic network control.

Most of the material of the thesis comes from a re-elaboration of material co-authored and
published in a number of books, journal papers, conference proceedings, and technical reports.

Matsuo and Mori (2001) [302] have proposed Accelerated Ants Routing, which is an extension
to MANETs of the ideas of Subramanian et al. [411]. They add the rule that uniform ants do not
return to an already visited node, and make these ants to hold the history about the n last visited
nodes. In this way, routing information can be updated not only toward the source, but all the
intermediate nodes. The algorithm heavily rely on the uniform ants, and no on-demand actions
are taken. It has been compared for a small 10 nodes network to Q-routing, dual Q-routing [264],
and to the original algorithm making use of uniform ants, showing better performance than the
competitors. In a later paper [178] the algorithm was tested in a 56 node network, and compared
also to AntNet, again showing better performance and faster convergence.
(Accelerated ants routing in dynamic networks)


C&#136;amara and Loureiro (2001) [69, 68] describe a location-based algorithm which makes use
of ant agents to collect and disseminate routing information in MANETs. Every node keeps in a
routing table location information of all the other nodes, and routing paths are calculated with a
shortest path algorithm. To keep the tables up-to-date, information is exchanged locally among
neighbors, and globally by sending ants to nodes further away. In practice, ants implement
an efficient form of flooding. The algorithm is compared to another popular location-based
algorithm, LAR [255] and shows less overhead and comparable performance.
(A novel routing algorithm for ad hoc networks,
[[Gps/ant-like routing in ad hoc networks]])

Sigel, Denby, and He¬¥arat-Mascle (2002) [389] have applied a straightforward modication
(and simplification) of AntNet to the problem of adaptive routing in the LEO satellite network.
Some experimental results from simulations are discussed taking into account some possibly
realistic traffic patterns in terms of both voice and data telecommunication. The algorithm is
compared to more a classical routing algorithms such as SPF (see next chapter), as well as to
an &#148;ideal&#148; realization of it aimed at providing a kind of performance upper bound. Overall,
the performance of the proposed algorithm is near-optimal and much better than that of SPF,
especially for high non-bursty traffics.
(Application of ant colony optimization to adaptive routing in a LEO telecommunications satellite network)

G¬® unes et al. (2002) [211, 210] introduced Ant-Colony-Based Routing Algorithm (ARA), which
does not differ much from other popular MANET algorithms like AODV. In fact, it works in a
purely on-demand way, with both the forward and backward ants setting up the paths about the
node they are coming from. Also data packets do the same, reducing in this way the node for
sending more ants. The reported performance was slightly better than that of AODV but worse
than that of DSR [236] in highly dynamic environments.
([[Ant-routing-algorithm (ARA) for mobile multi-hop ad-hoc networks - new features and results]],
[[ARA - the ant-colony based routing algorithm for MANETS]])

Marwaha et al. (2002) [301] have proposed Ant-AODV, an hybrid algorithm combining
ants with the basic AODV behavior. A certain number of ants keeps going around the network
in a more or less random manner, keeping track of the last n visited nodes and when they arrive
at a node they update its routing table. The behavior of the algorithm is like AODV, but the
presence of the ants is supposed to boost AODV's performance. In fact, they proactively refresh
routing tables, increasing the chance that either the node will have a route available or one
of its neighbors has. Moreover, ants can discover better paths than those currently in use by
AODV and the paths can be rerouted. According to the reported simulation studies, Ant-AODV
performs usually better than the simple ant-based algorithm or AODV separately.
(Mobile agents based routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks)

In [14] Baras and Mehta (2003) propose two algorithms for MANETs. The first is very similar
to AntNet: it is in fact purely proactive, trying to maintain pheromone entries for all the
destinations. It differs from AntNet because of data packets that are routed deterministically
and ants taking also random uniform decisions for the purpose of unbiased exploration. The
algorithm does not work very well, due to the large amount of routing overhead, and the inefficient route discovery. The second version of the algorithm, called Probabilistic Emergent Routing
Algorithm (PERA), is much closer to AODV. In fact, the algorithm becomes purely reactive: ants
are only sent out when a route is needed. Also, they are now broadcast instead of being unicast
to a certain destination. In this way, the forward ants are in practice identical to route request
messages in AODV and DSR. The only difference stays in the fact that multiple routes are set
up, but actually only the one with the highest probability is actually used by data, with the
other being available for quick recovery from link failures. The performance of the algorithm is
comparable to that of AODV.


In [221], Heissenb ¬® uttel and Braun (2003) describe an ant-based algorithm for large scale
MANETs. The algorithm is quite complicate and makes use of geographical partitioning of the
node area. It shares some resemblance with the Terminode project [40, 39].
