*Abstract

Recent developments in information technology have brought about important changes in dis-
tributed computing. New environments such as massively large-scale, wide-area computer net-
works and mobile ad hoc networks have emerged. Common characteristics of these environments
include extreme dynamicity, unreliability and large scale. Traditional approaches to designing
distributed applications in these environments based on central control, small scale or strong reli-
ability assumptions are not suitable for exploiting their enormous potential. Based on the obser-
vation that living organisms can eectively organize large numbers of unreliable and dynamically-
changing components (cells, molecules, individuals, etc.) into robust and adaptive structures, it
has long been a research challenge to characterize the key ideas and mechanisms that make biolog-
ical systems work and to apply them to distributed systems engineering. In this paper we propose
a conceptual framework that captures several basic biological processes in the form of a family
of design patterns. Examples include plain diusion, replication, chemotaxis and stigmergy. We
show through examples how to implement important functions for distributed computing based on
these patterns. Using a common evaluation methodology, we show that our bio-inspired solutions
have performance comparable to traditional, state-of-the-art solutions while they inherit desirable
properties of biological systems including adaptivity and robustness.
