*Abstract

In this paper we describe AntHocNet, an algorithm for routing in mobile ad hoc
networks. It is a hybrid algorithm, which combines reactive route setup with
proactive route probing, maintenance and improvement. The algorithm is based
on the Nature-inspired Ant Colony Optimization framework. Paths are learned by
guided Monte Carlo sampling using ant-like agents communicating in a stigmergic
way. In an extensive set of simulation experiments, we compare AntHocNet with
AODV, a reference algorithm in this research area. We show that our algorithm
can outperform AODV on different evaluation criteria. AntHocNet's performance
advantage is visible over a broad range of possible network scenarios, and increases
for larger, sparser and more mobile networks. AntHocNet is also more scalable
than AODV.

* Êó¢Â≠ò Ant Routing „Å®„ÅÆÈñ¢‰øÇ

*1 Introduction

All these ingredients have been reverse-engineered in the framework of ACO, which exploits
the mechanisms behind the ant colony shortest path behavior to dene a Nature-inspired metaheuristic
for combinatorial optimization. ACO features a multi-agent organization, stigmergic
communication among the agents, distributed operations, use of a stochastic decision policy
to construct solutions, stigmergic learning of the parameters of the decision policy, and so
on. It has been applied with success to a variety of combinatorial problems (e.g., travelling
salesman, vehicle routing, scheduling, etc., see [14, 15] for overviews), as well as to routing
(e.g., [12, 41, 43]). The first ACO routing algorithms were designed for wired networks (e.g.,
AntNet [12] for packet-switched networks and ABC [41] for circuit-switched networks). These
algorithms exhibit a number of interesting properties which are also desirable for MANET routing:
they work in a fully distributed way, are highly adaptive to network and traffic changes, use
mobile agents for active path sampling, are robust to agent failures, provide multipath routing,
and automatically take care of data load spreading. However, the fact that they crucially rely
on repeated path sampling can cause significant overhead if not dealt with carefully. There have
already been some attempts to design ACO routing algorithms for MANETs. Examples are
ARA [21] and PERA [2]. However, these algorithms loose much of the proactive sampling and
exploratory behavior of the original ant-based algorithms in their attempt to limit the overhead
caused by the ants.

With AntHocNet we aim to design an algorithm which can work efficiently in MANETs while
maintaining those properties which make ACO routing algorithms so appealing. In particular,
while most of the previous algorithms for wired networks were mainly adopting a proactive
scheme by periodically generating ant-like agents for all possible destinations, AntHocNet follows
a hybrid approach. Ants are generated according to both proactive and reactive schemes.

!!2.2 ACO routing algorithms
The basic idea behind ACO algorithms for routing [11, 14] is the acquisition of routing information
through sampling of paths using small control packets, which are called ants. The ants
are generated concurrently and independently by the nodes, with the task to test a path to an
assigned destination. An ant going from source node s to destination node d collects information
about the quality of the path (e.g. end-to-end delay, number of hops, etc.), and uses this on its
way back from d to s to update the routing information at the intermediate nodes. Ants always
sample complete paths, so that routing information can be updated in a pure Monte Carlo way,
without relying on bootstrapping information from one node to the other [44].

The routing tables contain for each destination a vector of real-valued entries, one for each
known neighbor node. These entries are a measure of the goodness of going over that neighbor on
the way to the destination. They are termed pheromone variables, and are continually updated
according to path quality values calculated by the ants. The repeated and concurrent generation
of path-sampling ants results in the availability at each node of a bundle of paths, each with an
estimated measure of quality. In turn, the ants use the routing tables to dene which path to
their destination they sample: at each node they stochastically choose a next hop, giving higher
probability to those links which are associated with higher pheromone values.
This process is quite similar to the pheromone laying and following behavior of real ant
colonies. Like their natural counterparts, the articial ants are in practice autonomous agents,
and through the updating and stochastic following of pheromone tables they participate in
a stigmergic communication process. The result is a collective learning behavior, in which
individual ants have low complexity and little importance, while the whole swarm together can
collect and maintain up-to-date routing information.
This pheromone information is used for routing data packets, more or less in the same way as
for the routing of ants: all packets are routed stochastically, choosing with a higher probability
those links associated with higher pheromone values. In this way data for a same destination are
spread over multiple paths (but with more packets going over the best paths), resulting in load
balancing. For data packets, mechanisms are usually adopted to avoid low quality paths, while
ants are more explorative, so that also less good paths are occasionally sampled and maintained
as backup paths in case of failure or sudden congestion. In this way path exploration is kept
separate from the use of paths by data. If enough ants are sent to the dierent destinations,
nodes can keep up-to-date information about the best paths, and automatically adapt their data
load spreading to this.
2.3 ACO routing in MANETs
The description of the previous subsection highlights a number of key ingredients of ACO
routing: routing tables are adapted and maintained via continuous and concurrent Monte Carlo
sampling of paths, data are stochastically spread over multiple paths, leading to automatic load
balancing based on path qualities, all routing and control decisions are taken locally, and the
system is robust with respect to agent failures. A number of attempts have been made to
incorporate these features into a MANET routing algorithm. Important challenges hereby are
the high change rate and in particular the limited bandwidth which con
icts with the continuous
generation of ant packets.
Accelerated Ants Routing [17, 31] uses ant-like agents which go through the network randomly,
without a specic destination, updating pheromone entries pointing to their source. In [5] the
authors describe a location-based algorithm which makes use of ant agents to disseminate routing
information; here the ants serve as an ecient form of 
ooding. Ant-AODV [30] is a hybrid
algorithm combining ants with the basic AODV behavior: a xed number of ants keep going
around the network in a more or less random manner, keeping track of the last n visited nodes
and when they arrive at a node they proactively update its routing table. Ant-Colony-Based
Routing Algorithm (ARA) [21] works mainly in an on-demand way, with ants setting up multiple
paths between source and destination at the start of a data session. During the data session,
data packets reinforce the paths they follow. Also Probabilistic Emergent Routing Algorithm
(PERA) [2] works in an on-demand way, with ants being broadcast towards the destination
(they do not follow pheromone) at the start of a data session. Multiple paths are set up, but
only the one with the highest pheromone value is used by data (the other paths are available
for backup).
Also other ACO routing algorithms [23, 37, 42] have been proposed for MANETs. In general,
however, most of all these algorithms move quite far away from the original ACO routing ideas
trying to obtain the eciency needed in MANETs, and many of them are not very dierent
from single-path on-demand algorithms.

2.4 Elements of ACO routing in other MANET routing algorithms
Some of the ingredients of ACO routing appear separately in other MANET routing algorithms.
Especially the idea of multipath routing has received a lot of attention recently, both
in order to improve reliability and end-to-end delay (see [32] for an overview). The algorithms
dier in the way multiple paths are set up, maintained and used. At route setup time, the algorithm
selects a number of paths. Some algorithms allow braided multiple paths [18], whereas
others look for link [29] or node [48] disjoint paths, or even paths which are outside each other's
interference range [47]. Once the paths are set up, they need to be maintained. Most algorithms
manage the paths in a reactive way: they remove paths when a link break occurs, and only
take action when no valid path to the destination is left. The idea of proactively probing paths
to obtain up-to-date information about them and to detect failures can be found in few algorithms
[18, 46]. Proactively improving existing paths is quite rare in MANET routing algorithms,
although one possible approach is presented in [20] (in the context of single-path routing). The
use of the multiple paths diers strongly among algorithms. In many of them, only one of
the paths is used for data transport, while the others are only used in case of a failure in the
primary path [26, 33]. Some algorithms spread data over the multiple paths in a simple, even
way [27], and in a few cases adaptive data load spreading depending on the estimated quality of
paths, similar to the ACO ideas, is explored [18, 46]. The quality of paths is usually assessed in
terms of hop count or round trip time; combining dierent metrics is less common but can be
important [9]. Stochastic data spreading is to the best of our knowledge unexplored outside the
area of ACO routing algorithms.
