*Abstract
Research on a new metaheuristic for optimization is often initially focused on proof-of-concept
applications. It is only after experimental work has shown the practical interest of the method that
researchers try to deepen their understanding of the method’s functioning not only through more and
more sophisticated experiments but also by means of an effort to build a theory. Tackling questions
such as “how and why the method works’’ is important, because finding an answer may help in
improving its applicability. Ant colony optimization, which was introduced in the early 1990s as
a novel technique for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems, finds itself currently at
this point of its life cycle. With this article we provide a survey on theoretical results on ant colony
optimization. First, we reviewsome convergence results. Then we discuss relations between ant colony
optimization algorithms and other approximate methods for optimization. Finally, we focus on some
research efforts directed at gaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of ant colony optimization
algorithms. Throughout the paper we identify some open questions with a certain interest of being
solved in the near future.
