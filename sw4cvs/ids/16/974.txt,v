*Abstract
Recently, sensor network technologies have attracted attentions of many researchers for their
wide range of applications. Since each application has unique characteristics different from others,
including the area of region of deployment, a type of object to monitor or obtain information of,
the number of sensor nodes, the number of nodes that need sensor data of others, and the frequency
of needs for sensor data. In addition, those characteristics dynamically change in accordance with
changes in conditions of surroundings, topology of a sensor network due to addition, removal,
and movement of sensor nodes, and user’s requirements. Therefore, a communication protocol
for sensor networks must be adaptive to diverse and dynamically changing characteristics of applications.
In addition, since sensor nodes are prone to failure, a communication protocol must be
robust to failures of sensor nodes and faults in sensor nodes. Furthermore, to be scalable to the
number of sensor nodes and the area of the region, a communication protocol must operate in a
fully-distributed and self-organizing fashion.
In this thesis, we propose a new communication protocol for robust and scalable sensor networks.
Our protocol, ARCP (Ant-based Rendezvous Communication Protocol) is based on the
foraging behavior of ants. A sensor node that obtains sensor data emits data provision ants. On the
other hand, a sensor node that needs sensor data emits data gathering ants. They wander around
a sensor network while leaving pheromones. When an ant finds a trail of the other at a node, the
node becomes a rendezvous point where data provision ants and data gathering ants meet and sensor
data are passed from one to another. From a rendezvous point, an ant goes back to its nest, i.e.,
an originating node, while leaving rendezvous pheromones so that its nest mates can follow the
same path to the rendezvous point. Since each ant moves on its own decisions in accordance with
pheromones and no one ant has the dominant influence, ARCP is a fully distributed, robust, and
scalable protocol. Through simulation experiments, we show that our protocol outperforms the
other communication protocols from a viewpoint of the adaptability to application’s requirements,
the scalability to the number of sensor nodes, and the robustness to node failures with less control
overhead.
