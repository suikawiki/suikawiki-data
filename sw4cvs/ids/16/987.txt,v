*Abstract

Recent research has shown that capturing a scene
using several cameras has many advantages over traditional
single viewpoint or stereo capture. Here, we focus on multicamera
systems using Internet Protocol (IP) as the mode of
communication. As these networks of cameras grow in size,
the problem of handling the immense amount of data they are
capable of producing becomes an important problem. Our goal
is to build a system consisting of many inexpensive cameras
interconnected via an IP network and capable of rendering novel
views in a distributed and bandwidth-minimizing fashion. The
system should scale well as cameras are added to the network;
we wish to design a system that is capable of handling on the
order of 1000 cameras. The presented system utilizes in-network
processing in order to minimize the amount of bandwidth needed.
A novel data structure (the binmesh) is presented that enables us
to efficiently aggregate representations of available views at each
node. We present a working prototype of the system consisting
of 16 cameras, as well as simulation results for networks of up
to 1024 cameras.
