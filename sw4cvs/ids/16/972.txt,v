*Abstract

This paper describes a novel method of achieving
load balancing in telecommunications networks. A
simulated network models a typical distribution of calls
between arbitrary nodes; nodes carrying an excess of
traffic can become congested, causing calls to be lost.
In addition to calls, the network also supports a population
of simple mobile agents with behaviours modelled
on the trail laying abilities of ants. The ants move
across the network between arbitrary pairs of nodes,
selecting their path at each intermediate node according
the distribution of simulated pheromones at each
node. As they move they deposit simulated pheromones
as a function of their distance from their source
node, and the congestion encountered on their journey.
Calls between nodes are routed as a function of the
pheromone distributions at each intermediate node.
The performance of the network is measured by the
proportion of calls which are lost. The results of using
the ant-based control (ABC) are compared with those
achieved by using fixed shortest-path routes, and also
by using an alternative algorithmically-based type of
mobile agent previously proposed for use in network
management. The ABC system is shown to drop fewer
calls than the other methods, while exhibiting many
attractive features of distributed control.
