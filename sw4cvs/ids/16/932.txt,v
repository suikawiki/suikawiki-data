!!!Abstract

In wireless sensor network, a majority of packet
transmissions are delivered in the direction of a sink from
scattered sensors. Thus, each sensor node can be implicitly
provided the direction to forward sensing data towards the sink.
Most existing gradient approaches are based on this observation.
However, these approaches do not consider a mobility problem. In
this paper, we propose a new gradient flooding protocol in which
only hop count information is utilized as a cost metric for gradient
forwarding and each sensor is able to self-adjust this metric with
the minimum overhead whenever its movement occurs.
