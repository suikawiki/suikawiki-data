>An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one
or more of the MUST requirements for the protocols it
implements.  An implementation that satisfies all the MUST and
all the SHOULD requirements for its protocols is said to be
"unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST
requirements but not all the SHOULD requirements for its
protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant".
