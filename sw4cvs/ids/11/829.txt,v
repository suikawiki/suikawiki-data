:Bruce:What’s your fave feature that didn’t get into HTML 5 that you’d put into HTML 6?
:Hixie:In-window modal dialogs or dialog box—the kind of prompt you get when the computer asks you a question and won’t let you do anything else until you answer the question. For instance, the window that comes up when you say "Save As…" is usually a modal dialog.
>    Right now people fake it with divs and complicated styles and script. It would be neat to just be able to say "make this section a modal dialog". Like showModalDialog(), but within the page instead of opening a new window with a new page.
>    I’d add it to HTML 5, but there are so many new features already that we need to wait for the browsers to catch up.
