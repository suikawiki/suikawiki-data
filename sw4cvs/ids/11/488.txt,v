[1]  [CITE[Common XML - Final Draft Specification, 28 September 2000]] <http://www.simonstl.com/articles/cxmlspec.txt>


[2]

>Common XML begins with a frequently used and thoroughly reliable subset of the 
features provided by the XML 1.0 and Namespaces in XML W3C Recommendations.  
Common XML defines a very small core, but allows developers to move beyond that 
core if needed.  Additional features from XML 1.0 and Namespaces are still 
available. This specification includes descriptions of the impact of features 
beyond the core on interoperability.
