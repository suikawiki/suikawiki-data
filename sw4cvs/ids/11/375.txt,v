>The Cite schema offers a rich namespaced markup language for citations. Cite builds off of citation improvements recently added to DocBook, but is both more general, as well as suitable for use in GUI applications like office suites. Designed to be embedded in other XML document formats such as WordML and OpenOffice (for which is has been formally approved for inclusion), Cite is flexible enough to encode citations in demanding fields such as the humanities and law.
