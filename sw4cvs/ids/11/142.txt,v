>The main idea in this work is to bring XML and HTML into the domain of the Scheme programming language, and as such let the author and programmer use the power of abstraction and programmed solutions when he or she is doing web work. Web work includes web authoring in Scheme (programmatic authoring) and web programming, included XML transformation.
>
LAML allows you to generate a mirror of an arbitrary XML language in Scheme, by use of the LAML XML DTD parser and the XML-in-LAML mirror generation tool.
