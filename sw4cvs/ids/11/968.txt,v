[CITE@@en[Virtual Filesystems Are Virtual Office Documents]] ([CODE[2008-02-09 22:57:52 +09:00]] 版) <http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9373>

> Many modern applications store their documents as XML files. As filesystems and XML can be interchanged with libferris, this allows you to use those applications to edit filesystems directly. The main problem with having such applications edit filesystems directly instead of XML is that the schema of the application's XML file usually does not match the layout of the filesystem.
> This is where xsltfs:// can be used to create a translated filesystem that matches the layout the application is expecting. For example, you could take a table in a PostgreSQL database as the input filesystem and have the XSL massage that table into a virtual spreadsheet file, which you load into OpenOffice.org.
