Opera Software today announced that they have solved the problem of rendering Web pages effectively regardless of screen size. Opera's new Extensible Rendering Architecture (ERA) means no more horizontal scrolling and improved ability to print entire Web pages. In combination with Opera's Zoom function, ERA also presents a compelling accessibility feature with which users can magnify Web pages dramatically and still view them without having to scroll sideways.
