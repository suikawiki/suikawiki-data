@*          6.7. Distribution

          The Distribution  header  content  specifies  geographic  or
          organizational limits on an article's propagation:

               Distribution-content  = distribution *( dist-delim distribution )
               dist-delim            = ","
               distribution          = plain-component

A distribution is syntactically identical to a one-component
newsgroup name, and must satisfy the same rules and restrictions.   
In the absence of Distribution, the default distribution is "world".

配布は構文的には部品1つの新聞組名と同じで、同じ規則と制限を
満たさなければなりません。 Distribution が指定されていない場合の
既定値は「world」(世界)です。

               NOTE: This syntax has the disadvantage of contain-
               ing  no  white space, making it impossible to con-
               tinue a Distribution header across several  lines.
               Implementors  of  relayers  and reading agents are
               warned that it is intended that the  successor  to
               this  Draft  will  change  the  definition of dist
               delimiter to:

                    dist-delim = "," [ space ]

               and are urged to  fix  their  software  to  handle
               (i.e., ignore) white space following the commas.

          A relayer MUST not pass an article to another relayer unless
          configuration information  specifies  transmission  to  that
          other  relayer  of  BOTH  (a)  at least one of the article's
          newsgroup(s), and (b) at least one of the article's  distri-
          bution(s).   In effect, the only role of distributions is to
          limit propagation, by preventing  transmission  of  articles
          that would have been transmitted had the decision been based
          solely on newsgroups.

          A posting agent might wish to present  a  menu  of  possible
          distributions, or suggest a default, but normally SHOULD not
          supply a default without giving the poster a chance to over-
          ride  it.  A followup agent SHOULD initially supply the same
          Distribution header as found in the precursor, although  the
          poster MAY alter this if appropriate.

          Despite  the syntactic similarity and some historical confu-
          sion, distributions are  NOT  newsgroup  names.   The  whole
          point  of putting a distribution on an article is that it is
          DIFFERENT from the newsgroup(s).  In general,  a  meaningful
          distribution  corresponds to some sort of region of propaga-
          tion: a geographical area, an organization, or a cooperating
          subnet.

               NOTE:  Distributions  have  historically  suffered
               from the completely uncontrolled nature  of  their
               name  space,  the  lack  of feedback to posters on
               incomplete propagation resulting from use of  ran-
               dom  trash  in Distribution headers, and confusion
               with  newsgroups  (arising  partly  because   many
               regions  and  organizations DO have internal news-
               groups with names resembling their  internal  dis-
               tributions).  This has resulted in much garbage in
               Distribution headers, notably the pointless  prac-
               tice  of  automatically supplying the first compo-
               nent of  the  newsgroup  name  as  a  distribution
               (which is MOST unlikely to restrict propagation!).
               Many sites have opted to maximize  propagation  of
               such  ill-formed  articles by essentially ignoring
               distributions.  This unfortunately interferes with
               legitimate uses.  The situation is bad enough that
               distributions must be considered  largely  useless
               except  within  cooperating  subnets  that make an
               organized effort to restrain propagation of  their
               internal distributions.

               NOTE:  The  distributions "world" and "local" have
               no standard magic meaning (except that the  former
               is  the  default  distribution  if none is given).
               Some pieces of software do assign such meanings to
               them.

参考: 配布範囲「world」及び「local」(局地)には、(前者が省略時の
既定配布範囲であることを除いて)標準的な特別な意味はありません。
これに特別な意味を与えるソフトウェアもあります。
