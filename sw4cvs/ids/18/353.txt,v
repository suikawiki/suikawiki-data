Software Announcement
>
August 20, 2001
>
Effective August 20, 2001, WebSite Professional will be published by Deerfield.com. WebSite lead developer Bob Denny will continue development of the product, now named Deerfield WebSite. In 1994, Denny created the original 16-bit server for Windows 3.1 on which WebSite was based. Denny was the lead developer for WebSite throughout the six years the product was commercially available from O'Reilly & Associates. O'Reilly will no longer sell or support WebSite Professional.
>
Webboard is now published by ChatSpace.com, a leading online community software developer. ChatSpace will continue to support and develop WebBoard (see www.chatspace.com/press033001.htm). For more information on WebBoard, visit www.webboard.com.
>
In March, 2001, O'Reilly & Associates announced that we were discontinuing further development of software products. We're pleased that our two flagship products, WebSite and WebBoard, have found new homes and will continue to be developed and supported.
