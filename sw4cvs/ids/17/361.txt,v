:charset identification:
Specification of the charset used for a string of text.  <NONE>
>     Protocols that allow more than one charset to be used in the same
place should require that the text be identified with the
appropriate charset.  Without this identification, a program
looking at the text cannot definitively discern the charset of the
text.  Charset identification is also called "charset tagging".
