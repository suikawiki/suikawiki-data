To display text, a system puts characters on a visual display
device such as a screen or a printer.  To render text, a system
analyzes the character input to determine how to display the text.
The terms "display" and "render" are sometimes used
interchangeably.  Note, however,  that text might be rendered as
audio and/or tactile output, such as in systems that have been
designed for people with visual disabilities.  <NONE>

For simplicity, terms such as [DFN@@en[shown]], [DFN@@en[displayed]], and [DFN@@en[visible]] might sometimes be used when referring to the way a document is rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to imply a visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other media in equivalent ways.
