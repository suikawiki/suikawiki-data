This report has been submitted for publication to the International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications

IDSIA is a joint institute of both University of Lugano (USI) and University of Applied Sciences of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI),
and was founded in 1988 by the Dalle Molle Foundation which promoted quality of life.

*Abstract

This paper describes AntHocNet, an algorithm for routing in mobile ad hoc networks
based on ideas from the Ant Colony Optimization framework. In AntHocNet a source
node reactively sets up a path to a destination node at the start of each communication
session. During the course of the session, the source node uses ant agents to proactively
search for alternatives and improvements of the original path. This allows to adapt to
changes in the network, and to construct a mesh of alternative paths between source and
destination. The proactive behavior is supported by a lightweight information bootstrap-
ping process. Paths are represented in the form of distance-vector routing tables called
pheromone tables. An entry of a pheromone table contains the estimated goodness of
going over a certain neighbor to reach a certain destination. Data are routed stochasti-
cally over the dierent paths of the mesh according to these goodness estimates. In an
extensive set of simulation tests, we compare AntHocNet to AODV, a reactive algorithm
which is an important reference in this research area. We show that AntHocNet can out-
perform AODV for dierent evaluation criteria under a wide range of dierent scenarios.
AntHocNet is also shown to scale well with respect to the number of nodes.
