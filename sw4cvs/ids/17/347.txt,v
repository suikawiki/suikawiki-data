@* IETF における定義

[1] 
>
Localization is the process of adapting an internationalized
application platform or application to a specific cultural
environment.  In localization, the same semantics are preserved while
the syntax or presentation forms may be changed.
>   Localization is the act of tailoring an application for a different
language or script or culture.  Some internationalized applications
can handle a wide variety of languages.  Typical users understand
only a small number of languages, so the program must be tailored to
interact with users in just the languages they know.
