@* blocking problem に対して

The
blocking problem occurs when a route previously found by the ants is no longer available. It
can then take a relatively long time for the ants to find a new route.

で:

So far, we have not considered the blocking problem and the shortcut problem. We need to
avoid ‘freezing’ of the routes in situations that remain static for a long time and then suddenly
change. One way of doing this is by adding an exploration probability, or noise, to the random
walk of the ants; this will ensure that even apparently useless routes are used occasionally, so
that at least some information about them is present in the system to give a head start when a
route is blocked (e.g. by extreme node congestion or node failure). Noise might also encourage
the more rapid discovery of a better route which suddenly appears.

A convenient implementation is to arrange that a noise factor of f means that at every time
step an ant has probability f of choosing a purely random path, and probability (1-f) of choosing
its path according to the pheromone tables on the nodes. The possibly beneficial effects of
the addition of noise to ant-based algorithms were noted in (Deneubourg, 1990): ‘Rather than
simply tolerating a certain degree of error, it can even be desirable to deliberately add error
where none or little exists.’

* shortcut problem に対して

The shortcut problem
occurs when a new, shorter route suddenly becomes available. In this case the new route will
not easily be found, because the old trails are so strong that almost all the ants choose them.
