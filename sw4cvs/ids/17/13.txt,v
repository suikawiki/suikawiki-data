*ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present Railroad, a data dissemination architecture
for large-scale wireless sensor networks. Railroad system proactively
exploits a virtual infrastructure called Rail, which is an area
where all the metadata of event data are stored. There is only one
Rail in the network and it acts as a rendezvous area of the events
and the queries. Rail is placed in the middle area of the field so that
every node can easily access it. Once a query is issued, it circulates
around Rail and searches relevant data stored in Rail. When a relevant
metadata is found, the source node of the data transmits the
corresponding data to the sink node which has issued the query. By
using Rail, Railroad achieves a scalable and energy-efficient data
dissemination architecture under dynamic conditions with multiple
mobile observers and targets. We evaluate and compare the communication
cost and the hot spot message complexity of Railroad
with previous approaches.
