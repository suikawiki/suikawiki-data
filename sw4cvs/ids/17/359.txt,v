:on-the-wire encoding:
The encoding and decoding used before and after transmission over
the network is often called the "on-the-wire" (or sometimes just "wire") format.  <NONE>
>
Characters are identified by codepoints.  Before being transmitted
in a protocol, they must first be encoded as bits and octets.
Similarly, when characters are received in a transmission, they
have been encoded, and a protocol that needs to process the
individual characters needs to decode them before processing.
