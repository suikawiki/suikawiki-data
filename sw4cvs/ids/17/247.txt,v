>IDNA does not apply to domain names in the NAME and RDATA fields of
DNS resource records whose CLASS is not IN.  This exclusion applies
to every non-IN class, present and future, except where future
standards override this exclusion by explicitly inviting the use of IDNA.

the CLASS of the record, and not on the TYPE except as noted below.
This will remain true, even as new TYPEs are defined, unless a new
TYPE defines TYPE-specific rules.  Special naming conventions for SRV
records (and "underscore labels" more generally) are incompatible
with IDNA coding as discussed in the Definitions document [RFC5890],
especially Section 2.3.2.3.  Of course, underscore labels may be part
of a domain that uses IDN labels at higher levels in the tree.
