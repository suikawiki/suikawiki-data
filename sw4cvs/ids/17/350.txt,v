> A glyph is an abstract form that represents one or more glyph
images.  The term "glyph" is often a synonym for glyph image,
which is the actual, concrete image of a glyph representation
having been rasterized or otherwise imaged onto some display
surface.  In displaying character data, one or more glyphs may be
selected to depict a particular character.  These glyphs are
selected by a rendering engine during composition and layout
processing. <UNICODE>
