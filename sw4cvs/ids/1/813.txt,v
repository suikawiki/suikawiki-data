*          5.6. Path

          The Path header's content indicates which relayers the arti-
          cle has  already  visited,  so  that  unnecessary  redundant
          transmission can be avoided:

               Path-content    = [ path-list path-delimiter ] local-part
               path-list       = relayer-name *( path-delimiter relayer-name )
               relayer-name    = 1*rn-char
               rn-char         = letter / digit / "." / "-" / "_"
               path-delimiter  = "!"

          The  Path  content  is a list of relayer names, separated by
          path delimiters, followed (after a final delimiter)  by  the
          local  part of a mailing address.  Each relayer MUST prepend
          its name, and a delimiter, to the Path content in all  arti-
          cles  it processes.  A relayer MUST not pass an article to a
          neighboring relayer whose name is already  mentioned  in  an
          article's  path list, unless this is explicitly requested by
          the neighbor  in  some  way.   The  Path  content  is  case-
          sensitive.

               NOTE:  The Path header supplied by a posting agent
               should normally contain only the local part.   The
               relayer  that the posting agent passes the article
               to for posting will prepend its  relayer  name  to
               get the path list started.

               NOTE:  Observe that the trailing local part is NOT
               part of the path list.  This Path header:

                    Path: fee!fie!foe!fum

               contains three relayer names:  "fee",  "fie",  and
               "foe".  A relayer named "fum" is still eligible to
               be sent this article.

               NOTE: This syntax has the disadvantage of contain-
               ing  no  white space, making it impossible to con-
               tinue a Path header across several lines.   Imple-
               mentors  of relayers and reading agents are warned
               that it is intended that  the  successor  to  this
               Draft will change the definition of path delimiter
               to:

                    path-delimiter = "!" [ space ]

               and are urged to  fix  their  software  to  handle
               (i.e.,  ignore) white space following the exclama-
               tion points.  They are urged to hurry;  some  ill-
               behaved  systems  reportedly  already feel free to
               add such white space.

               NOTE: RFC 1036 allows considerably more  flexibil-
               ity  in  choice  of delimiter, in theory, but this
               flexibility has never  been  used  and  most  news
               software  does  not  implement  it  properly.  The
               grammar reflects the current  reality.   Note,  in
               particular,  that  RFC 1036 treats "_" as a delim-
               iter, but in fact it is known to appear in relayer
               names occasionally.

          Because  an  article will not propagate to a relayer already
          mentioned in its path list, the path list MUST  not  contain
          any  names  other  than  those  of  relayers the article has
          passed through AS NEWS.  This is trivially obvious for  nor-
          mal  news  articles, but requires attention from the modera-
          tors of moderated newsgroups and the implementors and  main-
          tainers of gateways.

               NOTE:  For  the  same  reason,  a  relayer and its
               neighbors need to agree on the choice  of  relayer
               name,  and  names  should  not  be changed without
               notifying neighbors.

          Relayer names need to be unique  among  all  relayers  which
          will  ever  see  the articles using them.  A relayer name is
          normally either an "official" name for the host the  relayer
          runs  on,  or  some  other "official" name controlled by the
          same organization.  Except in cooperating subnets that agree
          to  some  other  convention, and don't let articles using it
          escape beyond the subnet, a relayer name MUST  be  either  a
          UUCP  name  registered  in the UUCP maps (without any domain
          suffix such as ".UUCP"), or a complete Internet domain name.
          Use  of a (registered) UUCP name is recommended, where prac-
          tical, to keep the length of the path list down.

          The use of Internet domain names in the path  list  presents
          one problem: domain names are case-insensitive, but the path
          list is case-sensitive.   Relayers  using  domain  names  as
          their  relayer names MUST pick a standard form for the name,
          and use that form consistently to the exclusion of all  oth-
          ers.   The  preferred  form for this purpose, which relayers
          SHOULD use, is the all-lowercase form.

               NOTE: It is arguably  unfortunate  that  the  path
               list is case-sensitive, but it is much too late to
               change this.   Most  Internet  sites  do,  in  any
               event,  use  one  standardized  form of their name
               almost everywhere.

          In the ordinary case, where the poster is the author of  the
          article,  the  local  part following the path list SHOULD be
          the local part of the poster's full Internet domain  mailing
          address.

               NOTE:  It  should  be just the local part, not the
               full address.  The character "@@" does  not  appear
               in a Path header.

          The  Path content somewhat resembles a mailing address, par-
          ticularly in the UUCP world with its manual routing and  "!"
          address  syntax.   Historically, this resemblance was impor-
          tant, and the  Path  content  was  often  used  as  a  reply
          address.  This practice has always been somewhat unreliable,
          since news paths are not always mail paths and news  relayer
          names  are  not  always recognized by mail handlers, and its
          reliability has generally worsened  in  recent  times.   The
          widespread   use  of  and  recognition  of  Internet  domain
          addresses, even outside the  actual  Internet,  has  largely
          eliminated  the  problem.   Readers  SHOULD not use the Path
          content as a reply address.   On  the  other  hand,  relayer
          administrators  are  urged  not  to break this usage without
          good reason; where practical, paths followed by news  SHOULD
          be  traversable  by mail, and mail handlers SHOULD recognize
          relayer names as host names.

          It will typically be difficult or impractical  for  gateways
          and  moderators to supply a Path content that is useful as a
          reply address for the author, bearing in mind that the  path
          list they supply will normally be empty.  (To reiterate: the
          path list MUST not contain any names  other  than  those  of
          relayers  the  article  has  passed  through AS NEWS.)  They
          SHOULD supply a local part that will result in replies to  a
          Path-derived  address  being  returned  to the sender with a
          brief explanation.   Software  permitting,  the  local  part
          "not-for-mail" is recommended.

               NOTE:  A  moderator  or  gateway administrator who
               supplies a local part that delivers such  mail  to
               an  administrative  mailbox  will quickly discover
               why it should be  bounced  automatically!   It  is
               best, however, for the returned message to include
               an explanation  of  what  has  probably  happened,
               rather than just a mysterious "undeliverable mail"
               complaint, since the sender may not be aware  that
               his/her  software  is unwisely using the Path con-
               tent as a reply  address.   Reply  software  might
               wish  to  question  attempts  to  reply to a Path-
               derived address ending in "not-for-mail" (which is
               why a specific name is being recommended here).
