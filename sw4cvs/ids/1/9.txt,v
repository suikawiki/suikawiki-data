Most of college students are immature and apply for credit cards without thinking how they will pay there debt back. By the way, most of them are already in debt with there student loans. They shouldn’t listen to those guys running around campuses offering credit cards but carefully compare the offers on professional websites such as

Don’t ever apply for a credit card without considering all the details. The best way to choose the right credit card is to make an apple-to-apple comparison. A great site that helps to do that is

Is it possible to save on credit cards at the same time spending as much as you are accustomed to? I’ve heard that it is possible to do by means of balance transfer credit cards with 0% intro APR. You move your current balance onto a new card and save on interest. The most important thing is not to make debt on the new card. For balance transfer credit cards you can go to

There is a reason why people get credit cards. You pay more but there is no other way to buy the things you want. The thing is that you need to carefully compare credit card deals before choosing the one that will cost you less. If you want to find one check out

I am in a financial trouble. When I divorced I saw that I had very little credit history, which was not enough to qualify for a new credit card of my own. All credit cards I have used before were in my husband’s name, so they were not reported to the credit bureaus. I wonder if I can start my own credit file through applying for a secured credit card at

There are so many credit card offers that it is always hard to choose. I would say that there are no bad or good credit cards, there are just credit cards that are bad or good for you. In order to understand which card is which you should consider your spending habits, your credit history and compare credit card offers from different banks and issuing companies. You can do that at

Credit cards are great if you can manage your money wisely. I always shop around for credit cards. I’ve figured out that official bank sites are not really helpful because you can’t compare there offers with those of other banks. So now I use

It’s always good to fix your credit first and then apply for a rewards credit card. Otherwise it will cost you more to have those cards. There are some nice offers for all types of credit at

I was stupid enough to use my Social Security number when I was filling out one of the forms online.  Now I can’t buy anything on any websites because I don’t want to use my credit card number.

Before you make the decision on how to make money with this credit card be sure to read the fine print. Can you get cashback for shopping at ANY supermarket or drugstore? Most of banks work with particular stores. Read all the details at

Don’t be silly and don’t apply for a credit card if you are not sure you will be able to pay it back. Credit cards are for those people that have money but want to make some more with credit card rebates and bonuses.  I know you have the money to apply for a credit card at
