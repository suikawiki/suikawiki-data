There [DEL[currently is not]] [INS[is a need for]] a standard mechanism for the reporting of mail
system errors [DEL[except for]] [INS[richer than]] the limited set offered by SMTP and the
system specific text descriptions sent in mail messages.  There is a
pressing need for a rich machine[INS[-]]readable[INS[,]] [INS[human language independent]]
status code for use in delivery status notifications [DSN].  This
document proposes a new set of status codes for this purpose.

@@@@

SMTP provides about 12 useful codes for delivery reports.  The
majority of the codes are protocol specific response codes such as
the 354 response to the SMTP data command.  Each of the 12 useful
codes are [DEL[each]] overloaded to indicate several error conditions [DEL[each]].
suffers some scars from history, most notably the unfortunate damage
to the reply code extension mechanism by uncontrolled use.  This
proposal facilitates future extensibility by requiring the client to
interpret unknown error codes according to the theory of codes while
requiring servers to register new response codes.

The SMTP theory of reply codes [INS[are] partitioned in the number space [INS[in]]
such a manner that the remaining available codes will not provide the space
needed.  The most critical example is the existence of only 5
remaining codes for mail system errors.  The mail system
classification includes both host and mailbox error conditions.

@@@@

The following [DEL[proposal]] [INS[status code set]] is based on the SMTP theory of reply
codes.  It adopts the success, permanent error, and transient error
semantics of the first value, with a further description and
classification in the second.  This proposal re-distributes the
classifications to better distribute the error conditions, such as
separating mailbox from host errors.

2. Status Code[DEL[s]] [INS[Structure]]

This document defines a new set of status codes to report mail system
conditions.  These status codes are [DEL[intended to be used]] [INS[used]] for media and
language independent status reporting.  They are not intended for
system specific diagnostics.

@@@@

[INS[
Example:  2.1.23
]INS]

@@@@

The class sub-code provides a broad classification of the status.
The enumerated values [DEL[the]] [INS[for each]] class are defined as:

2.[INS[XX]]X.[INS[XX]]X   Success

@@@@

4.[INS[XX]]X.[INS[XX]]X   Persistent Transient Failure

A persistent transient failure is one in which the message as
sent is valid, but [INS[persistence of]] some temporary [DEL[event prevents the successful sending of]] [INS[condition has caused abandonment or delay of attempts to send]] the message.  [INS[If this code accompanies a delivery failure report,]] Sending in the future may be successful.

5.[INS[XX]]X.[INS[XX]]X   Permanent Failure

@@@@

X.0.[INS[XX]X   Other or Undefined Status

@@@@

X.1.[INS[XX]]X   Addressing Status

@@@@

X.2.[INS[XX]]X   Mailbox Status

@@@@

X.3.[INS[XX]]X   Mail System Status

@@@@

X.4.[INS[XX]]X   Network and Routing Status

@@@@

X.5.[INS[XX]]X   Mail Delivery Protocol Status

The mail delivery protocol status codes report failures
involving the message delivery protocol.  These failures
include the full range of problems resulting from
implementation errors or an unreliable connection.  [DEL[Mail delivery protocol issues may be controlled by many parties including the originating system, destination system, or intermediate system administrators.]]

X.6.[INS[XX]]X   Message Content or Media Status

The message content or media status codes report failures
involving the content of the message.  These codes report
failures due to translation, transcoding, or otherwise
unsupported message media.  Message content or media issues
are under the control of both the sender and the receiver,
both of [DEL[whom]] [INS[which]] must support a common set of supported content-types.

X.7.[INS[XX]]X   Security or Policy Status

@@@@

The outbound connection was established, but was [DEL[otherwise]]
unable to complete the message transaction, either because
of time-out, or inadequate connection quality. This is
useful only as a persistent transient error.

@@@@

A routing loop caused the message to be forwarded too many
times, either because of incorrect routing tables or a 
user[INS[-]]forwarding loop. This is useful only as a persistent
transient error.

@@@@

The message was considered too old by the rejecting system,
either because it remained on that host too long or because
the time-to-live value specified by the sender of the
message was exceeded. If possible, the code for the actual
problem found when delivery was attempted should be returned
rather than this code.  [DEL[This is useful only as a persistent transient error.]]

@@@@

The message content must be converted [INS[in order]] to be forwarded but
such conversion is not possible or is not practical by a
host in the forwarding path.  This condition may result when
an ESMTP gateway supports 8bit transport but is not able to
downgrade the message to 7 bit as required for the next hop.
