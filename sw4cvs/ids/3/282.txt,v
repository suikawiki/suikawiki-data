本当に実装可能かどうかはまだわかんね。

[PRE[
Interface WikiImplementation
  This interface provides factory methods.  The objects 
  implementing this method must also implement the 
  DOMMinimumImplementation interface that provides "getFeature"
  and "hasFeature" methods.  WikiImplementation objects can be
  obtained via the DOMImplementationRegistry object with
  the feature @@@@FEATURE_NAME@@@@ with version "4.0" and might
  be accessed via the "getFeature" method of the DOMImplementation object.
  Methods
    createWikiEngine
      Creates a new instance of a wiki engine.
      Parameters
        features of type DOMString
          A list of feature names and versions (see DOM Level 3 Core recommendation)
          the wiki engine instance created by this method must be
          implementing.  Note that feature names may be prefixed by a PLUS SIGN.
      Return Value
        WikiEngine  A newly created wiki engine instance or "null"
                    if there is no implementation that supports
                    features requested by the "features" parameter.
    createWikiResponse
      Creates a new instance of wiki response object.
      Parameters
        features of type DOMString
      Return Value
        WikiResponse or "null"
      No Exception
    createWikiStorage
      Creates a new instance of wiki storage object.
      Parameters
        features of type DOMString
      Return Value
        WikiStorage  The newly created storage object or "null" if 
                     there is no storage implementation that provides
                     the features requested by "features" value.
      No Exceptions

Interface WikiEngine
  Attributes
    storageManager of type WikiStorageManager
      The wiki storage manager object that management the main
      database connected to this wiki engine.
    @@@@ WikiEngine and wiki application information
    wikiResources of type WikiResourceCollection, read-only
      The collection of the wiki resources assigned to this wiki engine.
  Methods
    initWikiEngine
      Initializes the attribute value of the wiki engine object. 
      This method may only be called before the wiki engine has been
      in use via the "request" method.  If this method is called several
      times before invoking "request" method, only the final invocation
      takes precedence.  This method has no effect if called
      after the wiki engine has been in use.
      Parameters
        rootResource of type WikiResourceCollection
          Specifies "wikiResources".
        storageManagerArg of type WikiStorageManager
          Specifies "storageManager".
      No Return Value
      No Exceptions
    request
      Posts (dispatches) a request to this wiki engine.  Note that depending on the
      language binding and configurations, the requests might
      be processed in asynchronous manner (i.e. processed in another
      thread).
      Any error or warning other than NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR (see "Exception")
      might be reported to the DOMError object associated to the session object
      or might be reported as the response of the session.
      Parameters
        requestArg of type WikiRequest
          An object which provides parameters that describe the request.
          Once a WikiRequest object is passed to this method,
          applications must not modify that object (and any
          objects which are considered "part" of it).  The wiki engine
          may make some modification to the objects.
      Return Value
        WikiSession    The session object which procedes the request.
      Exceptions
        WikiException  NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: The "requestArg" does not
                       provides enough information this wiki engine 
                       requests.  (For example, the "requestArg" 
                       object does not implement one or more interfaces
                       required by the wiki engine.)
]PRE]

[PRE[
Interface WikiRequest
  Objects implementing the WikiRequest interface provides
  information on the request, including what action should be done
  for what resource and how the result should be reported.
  Objects implementing this interface are expected to
  implement other interfaces so that the wiki engine
  produces meaningful results.
      Objects implementing this interface must also implement
  the GetFeature interface.
  Attributes
    wikiMethod of type DOMString
      A URI reference which identifies the operation requested
      by this object.
    wikiProtocol of type DOMString
      A URI reference which identifies the protocol by which
      the request has been issued.  It should also identify
      any gateway interface if necessary; for example, HTTP
      accesses received via the CGI/1.1 interface is identified
      by the URI @@@@NAMESPACE_URI@@@@.
    wikiResourceURI of type DOMString
      An absolute URI reference which identifies the resource
      which is the target of the operation requested by this object.
]PRE]

[PRE[
Interface WikiSession
  Attributes
    wikiEngine of type WikiEngine, read-only
    wikiRequest of type WikiRequest, read-only
      The request which initiates this session.
    wikiResponse of type WikiResponse, read-only
      The response object that the session is expected
      to complete.  If the session does not takes the
      form of simple request-response model, the value
      of this attribute might be "null".
  Methods
    initWikiSession
      Parameters
        wikiEngineArg of type WikiEngine
        wikiRequestArg of type WikiRequest
        wikiResponseArg of type WikiResponse

[PRE[
Interface WikiNode
  The object implementing the WikiNode interface must also implement
  the EventTarget interface defined by the DOM Level 3 Events specification.
  An event is dispatched following a path in the tree consists of WikiNode
  objects.  Since a WikiNode object may be a child of two or more
  WikiNode objects, there may be multiple pathes in the WikiNode grove.
  In such case, only one path selected by the context in which
  an event is dispatched is used for the event flow.  Because of the
  same reason, the path may contain a WikiNode object twice or more times.
      The object implementing the WikiNode interface must also implement
  the GetFeature interface.

@@@@ 適当な feature name & version を定義しておくべきか?
でもそれを使うためには getFeature メソッドが要るぞ。。。

[PRE[
Interface DOMMinimumImplementation extends GetFeature
  This is a lightweight interface of the DOM Level 3 DOMImplementation
  interface.  This interface is a superset of the DOM Level 1
  DOMImplementation interface and a subset of the DOM Level 3
  DOMImplementation interface.
    An object implementing this interface should be available via
  the "getDOMImplementation" method or the "getDOMImplementationList"
  method of the DOMImplementationRegistry object or via
  the "getFeature" method of the objects which implement
  GetFeature and/or DOMImplementation interface with
  the feature name 
  "http://suika.fam.cx/~wakaba/archive/2004/8/18/manakai-dom#Minimum"
  and the version "3.0".
