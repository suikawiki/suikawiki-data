[CITE[XBIS XML Information Set Encoding]] <http://xbis.sourceforge.net/>

>XBIS is an encoding format for XML documents that is fully convertible to and from text, with information set equivalence between the original document text and regenerated document text. It's intended for use in transmitting XML documents between application components, and is therefore designed for processing speed.
