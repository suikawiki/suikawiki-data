@[1] [CITE[IEMobile Team Weblog : Detecting Internet Explorer Mobile's User-Agent on the server]] ([TIME[2009-01-05 22:12:27 +09:00]] 版) <http://blogs.msdn.com/iemobile/archive/2006/08/03/Detecting_IE_Mobile.aspx>

There's one more bit of information for page authors, and that's a particular META tag.  If you want, you can build your page with:
>
-<meta name="MobileOptimized" content="width">
>
Setting it on your page can turn off all of our layout optimizations and do them all server-side or in HTML yourself, if you really want to be particular about how things look.  More information, including a full set of parameters for the content field, is available at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/mobilesdk5/html/wce51conLayoutMetaTag.asp
>
That tag, in particular, tells us to skip our fit-to-screen rendering decisions, and just view the page in the equivalent of "Desktop" view mode.  It's really useful if you try to build pages or sites that are targeted towards mobile end users.
