At least on the football field. "This is a game and event that Alois (Blackwell, TSU's athletic director) and I have been talking about for years," said UH athletic director Dave Maggard. "I am really pleased that this is coming about this year. "This is something that we have thought about as a city event. These are two institutions and two universities very close to one another geographically, and there is no reason why we should not be playing." Long time coming Blackwell, who was a star running back with the Cougars in the mid '70s, agreed. Over their 60 plus years of football, the Cougars have played the far flung likes of Detroit Mercy, Montana, Florida State, Idaho, Syracuse and Wyoming.

I have never been much in favour of online shopping. The idea that the ancient physical delight of strolling the marketplace or bazaar and taking in its sights and smells might one day be replaced by clicking and dragging from a desktop is one I have always found more repugnant than convenient. But that was before I found out aboutWhat is Etsy? If you ask its founder, 27 year old Brooklyn based Rob Kalin, Etsy is "a childhood word from a Fellini movie" that he chose because "it embodies the curiosity of imagination" (the naughty Kalin has also playfully told the press that Etsy comes...<br><a href='http://bestnews-4u.com/news/3439'>http://bestnews-4u.com/</a>
