>TeX4ht is a highly con&#64257;gurable TeX-based authoring system for producing hypertext. It interacts with TeX-based applications through style &#64257;les and postprocessors, leaving the processing of the source &#64257;les to the native TeX compiler. Consequently, TeX4ht can handle the features of TeX-based systems in general, and of the LaTeX and AMS style &#64257;les in particular.
