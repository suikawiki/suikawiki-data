@[1] [CITE@@en[Web Applications 1.0 r7634     Since this made it likely that overloaded servers would just get even more overloaded, pull back a little and let all 5xx errors stop EventSource reconnects. It still reconnects if the connection drops, though. (Compat: 5xxs don't cause reconnects in deployed browsers currently as far as I can tell.)]]
