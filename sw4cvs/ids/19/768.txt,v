@[1] [CITE@@en[Web Applications 1.0 r2529        MAJOR CHANGES: Revamp the way scripts are specified, along with their interaction with resolving relative URLs, etc. Give enough detail to justify objects in the DOM not being garbage collected randomly when still in use. Define script groups, to handle scripts going away during document.open() and session history navigation. Define why and how setTimeout(), database transactions, etc, handle page transitions. Drop the terms 'with' and 'without' script, use script is 'enabled'/'disabled' instead. Define 'unload' and 'beforeunload'. Rework how onfoo='' and .onfoo event handler attributes are defined. Rework how the content model of <noscript> is defined. Reword the way javascript: is defined to use the new terminology. Add a few notes of things that came up while I was doing all that.]]
