@[1] [CITE@@en[Web Applications 1.0 r7562 Update references to DOM spec so they call it its real name. (Boy am I late to _this_ party.) This update will also make <iframe seamless> do event retargetting once DOM is updated to support that (see bug 18780 - marked this bug 'editorial' since this change doesn't work without the DOM stuff). Also, a lot of clean-up to affected areas.]]
