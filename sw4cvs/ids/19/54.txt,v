:[CODE[Proxy-Support]]:
Introduced in IE5 (or 6?) to allow proxies to specify that they understand NTLM/Negotiate authentication schemes.  It has one legal value ("Session-Based-Authentication").  If present, IE will permit the multi-step NTLM/Negotiate handshake to take place through a proxy server.  Otherwise, the 401 is treated as a fatal error and returned to the client.
