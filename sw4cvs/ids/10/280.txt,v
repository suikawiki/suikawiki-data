@[1]  [[HSML]] 用の [[DOM]] [[界面]]として考えていたと中の奴


Interface HSMLDocument extends HTMLDocument
  Attribute
    slideLength of type unsigned long, read-only
      The number of the slides in this document.
  Methods
    appendNewSlide
      Inserts a new slide to the last of the slide sequence.
      
      No Parameter
      Return Value
        HSMLSlide   The newly created slide.
      Exception
        DOMException NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: If the parent element
                     to which the new slide is appended is read-only.
    getSlide
      Returns an element that defines a slide.
      
      Parameter
        n of type unsigned long
          The ordinal index of the slide to return. 
          If 0 is specified, the first slide is returned.
      Return Value
        HSMLSlide   The nth slide if any; otherwise null is returned.
      Exception
        DOMException INDEX_SIZE_ERR: If n is negative or greater than 
                     the number of slides.
    insertNewSlideBefore
      Inserts a slide before a slide and returns it.
      
      Parameter
        refSlide of type HSMLSlide
          (?? @@@@ ??)
      Return Value
        HSMLSlide   The newly created slide.
      Exception
        DOMException HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: If the refSlide is not a
                     slide in use.
                     NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: If the parent element
                     to which the new slide is appended is read-only.
                     WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: If the refSlide was not created
                     in this document.

Interface HSMLSlide
  This interface is implemented by objects which define slides.
  It can be obtained by Node.getFeature method of the element by which
  a slide is defined or by binding-dependent casting mechanism.
  
  Attributes
    previousSlide of type HSMLSlide, read-only
      The previous slide, if any, or null.
    nextSlide of type HSMLSlide, read-only
      The next slide, if any, or null.
    heading of type Element, read-only
      The heading element of this slide, if any, or null.
      (?? HTMLBlockLevelContainerExtended.heading ??)

Interface ViewHSML
  Objects implementing this interface must also implement
  the AbstractView interface [DOM Level 2 Views].
  
  Attributes
    currentSlide of type HSMLSlide, read-only
      The current slide or null if there is no slide.  Note that
      if no slide is set to current by DOM methods such as 
      ViewHSML.showSlide or by non-DOM mechanisms, the first 
      slide (the HSMLSlide obtained by the method HSMLDocument.getSlide
      with the n parameter set to 0) is returned.
  Methods
    showSlide
      Selects a slide as current slide.
      Changing the current slide might affect the rendering.
      
      Parameter
        n of type unsigned long
          The ordinal index of the slide to return. 
          If 0 is specified, the first slide is set to current.
      Return Value
        HSMLSlide   The new current slide.
      Exception
        DOMException INDEX_SIZE_ERR: If n is negative or is greater than
                     the number of slides in the document.
    showPreviousSlide
      Selects the slide just before the current slide.
      If the current slide is the first slide, the last slide is selected.
      Changing the current slide might affect the rendering.
      
      No Parameter
      Return Value
        HSMLSlide   The new current slide or null if there is no slide.
      No Exception
    showNextSlide
      Selects the slide just after the current slide.
      If the current slide is the last slide, the first slide is selected.
      Changing the current slide might affect the rendering.
      
      No Parameter
      Return Value
        HSMLSlide   The new current slide or null if there is no slide.
      No Exception@
