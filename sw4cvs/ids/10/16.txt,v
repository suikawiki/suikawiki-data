>Aural Cascading Style Sheets [CSS2  §19] are employed to augment standard visual forms of documents (like HTML) with additional elements that assist in the synthesis of the text into audio. In comparison to SSML, ACSS-generated documents are capable of more complex specifications of the audio sequence, including the designation of 3D location of the audio source. Many of the other ACSS elements overlap SSML functionality, especially in the specification of voice type/quality. SSML may be viewed as a superset of ACSS capabilities, excepting spatial audio.
