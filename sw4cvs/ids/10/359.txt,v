[CITE[The tbook System for XML Authoring]] <http://tbookdtd.sourceforge.net/index.html>

> '''t'''ook offers the following:
- An XML file format that is suitable for demanding, especially scientific, texts, but it is also as simple and small as possible, and uses similar names as LaTeX.  Supported document classes: book, article and letter.
- It produces HTML, XHTML+MathML, Postscript, PDF and DocBook output.
- It works with formulas, graphics, tables, (all three with numbering) bibliography, and index.  Tools that have proven their efficiency with LaTeX (BibTeX, xindy etc.) are also usable with tbook.
- The print output caters high typographic demands, using LaTeX typesetting mechanisms.  This includes high quality graphics and their labelling with Psfrag.  Additionally, it produces small PDFs.
- It is easily configurable.  For LaTeX via a user package file, for HTML via a CSS fragment, and there are yet other ways.
- As much as possible is done automatically, e.g. via shell scripts that are synchronised with the document continually.
- It works with different languages and allow for direct unicode input.  Supported languages so far: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Finnish, and Russian.
- It is possible to input XML code directly without being killed by tons of characters.  (That counts twice for formulas.)
- It's a real life tool, no academic project.  If it doesn't work properly for you, complain!
