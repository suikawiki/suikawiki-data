>The Document Object Model Activity is closed. The Document Object Model Working Group was closed in the Spring of 2004, after the completion of the DOM Level 3 Recommendations. Several W3C Working Groups have since taken the lead in maintaining and continuing to develop standard APIs for the Web since then; HTML, SVG, CSS, or WebAPI being among them. W3C will continue to develop APIs in various Working Groups. Learn more about the achievements from the DOM Activity page. Got an idea on how to use this page? Send an email to Philippe.
