>17.4.9 divId (Associated HTML div ID)
>This element specifies the HTML div information which is associated with the current table row. This
information, stored in the Web Settings part, is used to associate one or more table rows with a particular HTML
div element.
;; [Note: This property is used when saving an HTML document into the WordprocessingML format
in order to prevent a loss of all HTML div information, so that the document can later be saved back into HTML
format and have the stored information replaced, since the HTML div can store formatting properties on
arbitrary regions. end note]
>
In order to determine the associated HTML div properties, the value of the val attribute on this element is used
to look up an associated div element (§17.15.2.8) whose id attribute matches this value.
>
If this table row does not have a divId element present, then this table row shall not have any associated HTML
div information. If this element is present, but the val attribute specifies an id value which does not have an
associated div element, then this element is ignored.
>
[Example: Consider an HTML document defined as follows:
[PRE(HTML example code)[
<html>
  <body>
    <div style="…">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>R1C1</td>
           …
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        …
      </p>
    </div>
    …
  </body>
</html>
>
This HTML document specifies a div spanning the table and the first paragraph. If this document is saved into
WordprocessingML, then both the rows of the table and the paragraph must have a divId which points at the
same div information in the web settings part:
[PRE(XML example code)[
<w:trPr>
  …
  <w:divId w:val="1102603671"/>
</w:trPr>
]PRE]
>
The val attribute then points at a div element which stores the associated div properties:
[PRE(XML example code)[
<w:divs>
  <w:div w:id="1102603671">
    …
  </w:div>
</w:divs>
]PRE]
