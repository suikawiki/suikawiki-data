>A [DFN@@en[built-in object]] is any [[object]] supplied by an [[]ECMAScript]] [[implementation]], 
independent of the [[host environment]], which is present at the start of the [[execution]] of an [[ECMAScript]] [[program]].
Standard [[built-in objects]] are defined in this specification, and an [[ECMAScript]] [[implementation]] [[may]]
specify and define others. Every [[built-in object]] is a [[native object]].
