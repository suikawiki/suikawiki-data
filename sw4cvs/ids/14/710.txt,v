[2] [CITE@@en['''['''Apache-SVN''']''' Revision 77941]] ([TIME[2009-07-19 12:07:34 +09:00]] 版) <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=77941>

>
Work around a bug in Netscape Navigator versions 2.x, 3.x and 4.0b2's
parsing of headers.  If the terminating empty-line CRLF occurs starting
at the 256th or 257th byte of output, then Navigator will think a normal
image is invalid.  We are guessing that this is because their initial
read of a new request uses a 256 byte buffer. We check the bytes written
so far and, if we are about to tickle the bug, we instead insert a
padding header of eminent bogosity.
