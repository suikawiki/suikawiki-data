@[1] [CITE[RIF RDF and OWL Compatibility]] ([TIME[2009-07-03 23:52:46 +09:00]] ç‰ˆ) <http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-rif-rdf-owl-20090703/#note-generalized-rdf-graphs>

>Standard RDF graphs, as defined in [RDF-Concepts], do not allow the use of literals in subject and predicate positions and blank nodes in predicate positions. The RDF Core working group has listed two issues questioning the restrictions that literals may not occur in subject and blank nodes may not occur in predicate positions in triples. Anticipating lifting of these restrictions in a possible future version of RDF, we use the more liberal notion of generalized RDF graph. We note that the definitions of interpretations, models, and entailment in the RDF semantics document [RDF-Semantics] also apply to such generalized RDF graphs.
>
We note that every standard RDF graph is a generalized RDF graph. Therefore, our definition of combinations applies to standard RDF graphs as well.
>
We note also that the notion of generalized RDF graphs is more liberal than the notion of RDF graphs used by SPARQL; generalized RDF graphs additionally allow blank nodes and literals in predicate positions.
