@[1] [CITE@@en[Web Applications 1.0 r8229 The giant clean-up of 2013. Improved internal consistency, adjusted section order to make more sense, started a move away from abusing title='' for cross-references, fixed minor typos, cleaned up some dangling TODOs, very minor typo fixes, dropped some obsolete comments, un-commented-out minor things that had previously been commented out for reasons that no longer apply, etc. No normative changes.]]
