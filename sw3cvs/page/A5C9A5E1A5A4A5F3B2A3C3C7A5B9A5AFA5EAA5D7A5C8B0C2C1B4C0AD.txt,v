> User agents must therefore implement security mechanisms to block cross-domain accesses (where local files are considered a separate domain). Such mechanisms are referred to as cross-domain scripting security mechanisms. Unfortunately, since it is difficult to predict exactly what attack vectors may exist in such a complex system, and in particular because it depends on the exact feature set of the implementation, this specification does not define the exact mechanism that must be implemented.
