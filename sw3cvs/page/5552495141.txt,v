[CITE[URIQA: The Nokia URI Query Agent Model]] <http://sw.nokia.com/uriqa/URIQA.html>

>URIQA (URI Query Agent) is a model for knowledge discovery, both from authoritative sources as well as from arbitrary third party sources. It introduces an extension to the present web architecture used to indicate to a web server that it should resolve the specified URI in terms of knowledge about the resource denoted by that URI rather than in terms of a representation of the resource in question.
