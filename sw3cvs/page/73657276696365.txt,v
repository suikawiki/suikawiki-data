>Sample RMI Client URL: service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:2003/jmxdemo
>    The rmi:// part specifies that the JMX server is serving RMI. Notice that the client URL does not specify the JMXConnectorServer endpoint. The /jndi/rmi://localhost:2003/jmxdemo part specifies that the jndi key jmxdemo should be used to look up the rmi stub in an rmi registry server running at localhost:2003. 
Sample JMXMP Client URL: service:jmx:jmxmp://localhost:2004
>    No explanation is needed for this one. This is the client URL to connect up to a JMXConnectorServer endpoint at localhost:2004 using the jmxmp protocol.
