>This Structured Syntax (SSYN) specification defines a set of both abstract and syntactic rules designed for the interchange of structured information.
>
SSYN has been designed as an alternative to XML for the increasing number of cases where XML is currently used to store information in a rigidly structured manner. SSYN is woefully inadequate for use with document-like information where the core of the document content is “a piece of continuous text” and can, thus, never be a replacement for XML.
>
SSYN has been designed to be as simple as possible for developers who implement the tools that process SSYN documents, developers who use those tools, and authors of SSYN documents while still being flexible enough to accommodate a variety of use cases.
>
SSYN is meant to be easy to read. Structure is clearly delineated with indentation.
