*RFC 2616 (HTTP) 14.45  Via
>The Via general-header field MUST be used by gateways and proxies to
indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user
agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and
the client on responses. It is analogous to the "Received" field of
RFC 822 [9] and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards,
avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of
all senders along the request/response chain.

[1] Via 一般頭欄は関門や串が、利用者代理者と要求先サーバー間の、
および源サーバーと応答の顧客間の媒介プロトコルと受信者を示すのに
使わ'''なければなりません'''。これは RFC 822 の「Received」欄
([[Received:領域]]) に対応していて、メッセージの転送の追跡や
要求の循環の回避, 要求・応答の鎖に居る全ての送信者のプロトコル能力の
特定に使うことを目的としています。

      Via =  "Via" ":" 1#( received-protocol received-by [ comment ] )
      received-protocol = [ protocol-name "/" ] protocol-version
      protocol-name     = token
      protocol-version  = token
      received-by       = ( host [ ":" port ] ) | pseudonym
      pseudonym         = token

   The received-protocol indicates the protocol version of the message
   received by the server or client along each segment of the
   request/response chain. The received-protocol version is appended to
   the Via field value when the message is forwarded so that information
   about the protocol capabilities of upstream applications remains
   visible to all recipients.

received-protocol は要求・応答の鎖の各部分のサーバー或いは顧客が
受信したメッセージのプロトコルの版を示します。 received-protocol
の版は、メッセージが転送された時に Via 欄の値に追加されるので、
上流応用のプロトコル能力についての情報が全ての受信者に見えたまま
になります。

   The protocol-name is optional if and only if it would be "HTTP". The
   received-by field is normally the host and optional port number of a
   recipient server or client that subsequently forwarded the message.
   However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information,
   it MAY be replaced by a pseudonym. If the port is not given, it MAY
   be assumed to be the default port of the received-protocol.

protocol-name は、 "HTTP" である場合に限って省略可能です。
received-by 欄は通常、続けてメッセージを転送する、
受信したサーバー或いは顧客のホストと省略可能で港番号です。
しかし、本当のホストが繊細な情報であると考えられる時は、 pseudonym
(偽名)に置き換えても構いません。港が無い場合、 received-protocol
の既定値と仮定して'''構いません'''。

   Multiple Via field values represents each proxy or gateway that has
   forwarded the message. Each recipient MUST append its information
   such that the end result is ordered according to the sequence of
   forwarding applications.

複数の Via 欄値はメッセージを転送した各串・関門を表します。
各受信者はその情報を後置して、結果として転送した応用の順に並ぶように
し'''なければなりません'''。

   Comments MAY be used in the Via header field to identify the software
   of the recipient proxy or gateway, analogous to the User-Agent and
   Server header fields. However, all comments in the Via field are
   optional and MAY be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the
   message.

   For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user
   agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to
   forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes
   the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu.
   The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following
   Via header field:

       Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)

   Proxies and gateways used as a portal through a network firewall
   SHOULD NOT, by default, forward the names and ports of hosts within
   the firewall region. This information SHOULD only be propagated if
   explicitly enabled. If not enabled, the received-by host of any host
   behind the firewall SHOULD be replaced by an appropriate pseudonym
   for that host.

   For organizations that have strong privacy requirements for hiding
   internal structures, a proxy MAY combine an ordered subsequence of
   Via header field entries with identical received-protocol values into
   a single such entry. For example,

       Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 ethel, 1.1 fred, 1.0 lucy

        could be collapsed to

       Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 mertz, 1.0 lucy

   Applications SHOULD NOT combine multiple entries unless they are all
   under the same organizational control and the hosts have already been
   replaced by pseudonyms. Applications MUST NOT combine entries which
   have different received-protocol values.
