 compliant implementation MUST support the events listed in Table 1
   with the exception of "flash". If it uses some other, out-of-band
   mechanism for signaling line conditions, it does not have to
   implement the other events.

   In some cases, an implementation may simply ignore certain events,
   such as fax tones, that do not make sense in a particular
   environment.  Section 3.9 specifies how an implementation can use the
   SDP "fmtp" parameter within an SDP description to indicate its
   inability to understand a particular event or range of events.

   Depending on the available user interfaces, an implementation MAY
   render all tones in Table 5 the same or, preferably, use the tones
   conveyed by the concurrent "tone" payload or other RTP audio payload.
   Alternatively, it could provide a textual representation.

   Note that end systems that emulate telephones only need to support
   the events described in Sections 3.10 and 3.12, while systems that
   receive trunk signaling need to implement those in Sections 3.10,
   3.11, 3.12 and 3.14, since MF trunks also carry most of the "line"
   signals. Systems that do not support fax or modem functionality do
   not need to render fax-related events described in Section 3.11.
