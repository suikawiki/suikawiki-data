*RFC 850 2.2.6  References  

This field lists the  message  ID's  of
any articles prompting the submission of this article.  It
is required for all follow-up articles, and forbidden when
a new subject is raised.  Implementations should provide a
follow-up command, which allows a user to post a follow-up
article.   This  command  should  generate  a Subject line
which is the same as the original article, except that  if
the original subject does not begin with "Re: " or "re: ",
the  four  characters   "Re: "  are  inserted  before  the
subject.   If  there is no References line on the original
header, the References line should contain the message  ID
of  the  original  article (including the angle brackets).
If the original article does have a References  line,  the
followup  article should have a References line containing
the text of the original References line, a blank, and the
message ID of the original article.

The purpose of the References header is to allow  articles
to  be  grouped  into  conversations by the user interface
program.  This allows conversations within a newsgroup  to
be  kept  together,  and  potentially users might shut off
entire conversations without unsubscribing to a newsgroup.
User  interfaces  may not make use of this header, but all
automatically  generated  followups  should  generate  the
References line for the benefit of systems that do use it,
and manually generated followups (e.g. typed in well after
the  original  article  has  been  printed by the machine)
should be encouraged to include them as well.

*RFC 1036

2.2.5.  References

    This field lists the Message-ID's of any messages prompting the
    submission of this message.  It is required for all follow-up
    messages, and forbidden when a new subject is raised.
    Implementations should provide a follow-up command, which allows a
    user to post a follow-up message.  This command should generate a
    "Subject" line which is the same as the original message, except
    that if the original subject does not begin with "Re:" or "re:", the
    four characters "Re:" are inserted before the subject.  If there is
    no "References" line on the original header, the "References" line
    should contain the Message-ID of the original message (including the
    angle brackets).  If the original message does have a "References"
    line, the follow-up message should have a "References" line
    containing the text of the original "References" line, a blank, and
    the Message-ID of the original message.

    The purpose of the "References" header is to allow messages to be
    grouped into conversations by the user interface program.  This
    allows conversations within a newsgroup to be kept together, and
    potentially users might shut off entire conversations without
    unsubscribing to a newsgroup.  User interfaces need not make use of
    this header, but all automatically generated follow-ups should
    generate the "References" line for the benefit of systems that do
    use it, and manually generated follow-ups (e.g., typed in well after
    the original message has been printed by the machine) should be
    encouraged to include them as well.

    It is permissible to not include the entire previous "References"
    line if it is too long.  An attempt should be made to include a
    reasonable number of backwards references.


*RFC 2822

See [[RFC2822の3.6.4]]

*[[draft-usefor-article]] (06)

**6.10.  References

   The References header lists optionally CFWS-separated message
   identifiers of precursors. The content syntax makes use of syntax
   defined in [RFC 2822].

      References-content  = msg-id *( CFWS msg-id )

        NOTE: This differs from the syntax of [RFC 2822] by requiring at
        least one CFWS between the msg-ids (this was an [RFC 1036]
        requirement).

   A followup MUST have a References header, and an article that is not
   a followup MUST NOT have a References header. In a followup, if the
   precursor did not have a References header, the followup's
   References-content MUST be formed by the message identifier of the
   precursor. A followup to an article which had a References header
   MUST have a References header containing the precursor's References-
   content (subject to trimming as described below) plus the precursor's
   message identifier appended to the end of the list (separated from it
   by CFWS).

   Followup agents SHOULD NOT trim message identifiers out of a
   References header unless the number of message identifiers exceeds
   21, at which time trimming SHOULD be done by removing sufficient
   identifiers starting with the second so as to bring the total down to
   21 (but the first message identifier MUST NOT be trimmed). However,
   it would be wrong to assume that References headers containing more
   than 21 message identifiers will not occur.
