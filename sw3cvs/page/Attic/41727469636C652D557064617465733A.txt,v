@*son-of-RFC1036           6.18. Article-Updates

          The  Article-Updates  header content indicates what previous
          articles this one is deemed (by the poster) to update (i.e.,
          replace):

               Article-Updates-content  = message-id *( space message-id )

          Each  message ID identifies a previous article that this one
          is deemed to update.  This MUST not cause the previous arti-
          cle(s)  to be cancelled or otherwise altered, unless this is
          implied by other headers (e.g. Supersedes);  Article-Updates
          is  merely an advisory which MAY be noted for special atten-
          tion by reading agents.

               NOTE: This header provides a way to mark  articles
               which  are  only  minor  updates of previous ones,
               containing no significant new information and  not
               worth reading if the previous ones have been read.

               NOTE: If suitable conventions using MIME multipart
               bodies  and  the "message/external-body" body-part
               type can be developed, a replacing  article  might
               contain  only differences between the old text and
               the new text, rather than  a  complete  new  copy.
               This  is  the  motivation  for not making Article-
               Updates also  function  as  Supersedes  does:  the
               replacing  article  might  depend on the continued
               presence of the replaced article.
