*sun-of-RFC1036 10.3. Message ID Mapping

This  section, like the previous one, is phrased in terms of
mail being gatewayed into news, but most of  the  discussion
should be more generally applicable.

          A  particularly  sticky problem of gatewaying mail into news
          is supplying legal news message IDs.  Note,  in  particular,
          that  not  all  MAIL message IDs are legal in news; the news
          syntax (specified in section 5.3, with related  material  in
          5.2)  is  more  restrictive.   Generating a fully-conforming
          news article from a mail message  may  require  transforming
          the message ID somewhat.

          Generation and transformation of message IDs assumes partic-
          ular importance if a given mailing  list  (or  whatever)  is
          being handled by more than one gateway.  It is highly desir-
          able that the same article contents not appear twice in  the
          same  newsgroup,  which  requires that they receive the same
          message ID from all gateways.  Gateways SHOULD use the  fol-
          lowing  algorithm (possibly modified by the later discussion
          of gatewaying into more than  one  newsgroup)  unless  local
          considerations dictate another:

               1. Separate message ID from surroundings, if necessary.
                  A plausible method for this is to start at the first
                  "<",  end at the next ">", and reject the message if
                  no ">" is found or a second "<" is seen  before  the
                  ">".  Also reject the message if the message ID con-
                  tains no "@@" or more than one "@@", or if it contains
                  no  ".".   Also reject the message if the message ID
                  contains non-ASCII characters, ASCII control charac-
                  ters, or white space.

                    NOTE:  Any  legitimate domain will include at
                    least one ".".  RFC 822 section 6.2.2 forbids
                    white space in this context when passing mail
                    on to non-MAIL software.

               2.   Delete the leading "<" and trailing ">".  Separate
                    message  ID into local part and domain at the "@@".

               3.   In both  components,  transliterate  leading  dots
                    (".", ASCII 46), trailing dots, and dots after the
                    first in sequences  of  two  or  more  consecutive
                    dots, into underscores (ASCII 95).

               4.   In both components, transliterate disallowed char-
                    acters other than  dots  (see  the  definition  of
                    <unquoted-char>  in  section  5.2)  to underscores
                    (ASCII 95).

               5.   Form the message ID as

                         "<" local-part "@@" domain ">"


               NOTE: This algorithm is approximately that of Rich
               Salz's successful gatewaying package.

          Despite  the  desire  to  keep message IDs consistent across
          multiple gateways, there is also a more  subtle  issue  that
          can  require a different approach.  If the same articles are
          being gatewayed into more than one newsgroup, and it is  not
          possible  to  arrange  that all gateways gateway them to the
          same cross-posted set of newsgroups, then the message IDs in
          the different newsgroups MUST be DIFFERENT.

               NOTE:  Otherwise,  arrival  of  an  article in one
               newsgroup  will  prevent  it  from  appearing   in
               another,  and which newsgroup a particular article
               appears in will be an accident of which  direction
               it  arrives  from  first.  It is very difficult to
               maintain a coherent discussion when each  partici-
               pant  sees a randomly-selected 50% of the traffic.
               The fundamental problem here  is  that  the  basic
               assumption  behind  message IDs is being violated:
               the gateways are assigning the same message ID  to
               articles  that  differ  in  an  important  respect
               (Newsgroups header).

          In such cases, it is suggested that the newsgroup  name,  or
          an agreed-on abbreviation thereof, be prepended to the local
          part of the message ID (with a separating ".") by the  gate-
          way.   This  will ensure that multiple gateways generate the
          same message ID, while also ensuring  that  different  news-
          groups can be read independently.

               NOTE:  It  is  preferable  to  have the gateway(s)
               cross-post the article, avoiding the  issue  alto-
               gether,  but  this may not be feasible, especially
               if one newsgroup is widespread and  the  other  is
               purely local.
