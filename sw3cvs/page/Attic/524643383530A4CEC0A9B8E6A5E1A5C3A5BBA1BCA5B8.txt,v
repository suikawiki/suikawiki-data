@*3.  Control Messages

This section lists the control messages currently defined.
The  body  of  the  Control header is the control message.
Messages are a sequence of zero or more  words,  separated
by  white  space  (blanks or tabs).  The first word is the
name  of  the  control  message,   remaining   words   are
parameters  to  the  message.  The remainder of the header
and the body of the message are also potential parameters;
for  example,  the  From  line might suggest an address to
which a response is to be mailed.

Implementors  and  administrators  may  choose  to   allow
control  messages  to  be automatically carried out, or to
queue  them  for  manual  processing.   However,  manually
processed messages should be dealt with promptly.

**3.1  Cancel

     cancel <message ID>

If an article with the given message ID is present on  the
local  system,  the  article is cancelled.  This mechanism
allows a user to cancel an article after the  article  has
been distributed over the network.

Only the author of the article or the local super user  is
allowed  to  use  this  message.  The verified sender of a
message is the Sender  line,  or  if  no  Sender  line  is
present, the From line.  The verified sender of the cancel
message must be the same as  either  the  Sender  or  From
field  of  the original message.  A verified sender in the
cancel message is allowed to match an unverified  From  in
the original message.

**3.2  Ihave/Sendme

     ihave <message ID list> <remotesys>
     sendme <message ID list> <remotesys>

This message is part  of  the   "ihave/sendme"   protocol,
which  allows  one  site  (say  "A")  to tell another site
("B")  that  a particular message has been received on  A.
Suppose  that site A receives article  "ucbvax.1234",  and
wishes to transmit the article to site  B.   A  sends  the
control  message   "ihave  ucbvax.1234  A"   to site B (by
posting it to newsgroup  "to.B").   B  responds  with  the
control  message   "sendme  ucbvax.1234  B"  (on newsgroup
to.A) if it has not already received  the  article.   Upon
receiving the Sendme message, A sends the article to B.

This protocol can be used to cut down on redundant traffic
between  sites.  It is optional and should be used only if
the particular situation makes it worthwhile.  Frequently,
the  outcome  is  that,  since  most original messages are
short, and since there is a high overhead to start sending
a  new  message  with  UUCP,  it costs as much to send the
Ihave as it would cost to send the article itself.

One possible solution to this overhead problem is to batch
requests.   Several  message  ID's  may  be  announced  or
requested in one message.  If no message ID's  are  listed
in  the control message, the body of the message should be
scanned for message ID's, one per line.

**3.3  Newgroup

     newgroup <groupname>

This control message creates a new newsgroup with the name
given.  Since no articles may be posted or forwarded until
a newsgroup is created, this message is required before  a
newsgroup  can  be  used.   The  body  of  the  message is
expected to be a short paragraph describing  the  intended
use of the newsgroup.

**3.4  Rmgroup

     rmgroup <groupname>

This message removes a  newsgroup  with  the  given  name.
Since  the  newsgroup  is  removed  from every site on the
network, this  command  should  be  used  carefully  by  a
responsible administrator.

**3.5  Sendsys

     sendsys (no arguments)

The   "sys"   file,  listing  all  neighbors   and   which
newsgroups  are  sent  to each neighbor, will be mailed to
the author of the control message (Reply-to,  if  present,
otherwise  From).   This  information is considered public
information, and it is  a  requirement  of  membership  in
USENET  that  this  information  be  provided  on request,
either automatically in response to this control  message,
or  manually,  by mailing the requested information to the
author of the message.  This information is used  to  keep
the  map  of  USENET  up  to  date, and to determine where
netnews is sent.

The format of the file mailed back to the author should be
the same as that of the  "sys"  file.  This format has one
line per neighboring site (plus one  line  for  the  local
site),  containing four colon separated fields.  The first
field has the site name of the neighbor, the second  field
has  a newsgroup pattern describing the newsgroups sent to
the neighbor.  The third and fourth fields are not defined
by this standard.  A sample response:

     From cbosgd!mark  Sun Mar 27 20:39:37 1983
     Subject: response to your sendsys request
     To: mark@@cbosgd.UUCP
     
     Responding-System: cbosgd.UUCP
     cbosgd:osg,cb,btl,bell,net,fa,to,test
     ucbvax:net,fa,to.ucbvax:L:
     cbosg:net,fa,bell,btl,cb,osg,to.cbosg:F:/usr/spool/outnews/cbosg
     cbosgb:osg,to.cbosgb:F:/usr/spool/outnews/cbosgb
     sescent:net,fa,bell,btl,cb,to.sescent:F:/usr/spool/outnews/sescent
     npois:net,fa,bell,btl,ug,to.npois:F:/usr/spool/outnews/npois
     mhuxi:net,fa,bell,btl,ug,to.mhuxi:F:/usr/spool/outnews/mhuxi

**3.6  Senduuname (uuname 送ってちょ)

     senduuname      (no arguments) (引数なし)

The  "uuname"  program is run, and the output is mailed to
the  author  of the control message (Reply-to, if present,
otherwise From).  This program lists all uucp neighbors of
the  local site.  This information is used to make maps of
the UUCP network.  The sys file is not  the  same  as  the
UUCP   L.sys   file.   The  L.sys  file  should  never  be
transmitted to another party without the  consent  of  the
sites whose passwords are listed therein.

「uuname」 (uu名) プログラムが実行され、出力が
制御メッセージの著者 (指定されていれば Reply-to (返信先) に、
なければ From (送信元)に) メイルで送られます。この位プログラムは
局地サイトの全ての uucp 隣人を列挙します。この情報は
UUCP 網の地図を作ります。 sys ファイルは UUCP L.sys ファイルと
同じではありません。 L.sys ファイルは合言葉が列せられている
サイトの同意無しに第三者に転送されることは決してあるべきではありません。

It is optional for a site  to  provide  this  information.
Some  reply  should  be  made to the author of the control
message, so that a transmission error won't be blamed.  It
is  also  permissible for a site to run the uuname program
(or in some other way determine the  uucp  neighbors)  and
edit  the output, either automatically or manually, before
mailing the reply back to the  author.   The  file  should
contain  one  site  per line, beginning with the uucp site
name.  Additional information may be  included,  separated
from the site name by a blank or tab.  The phone number or
password for the site should NOT be included, as the reply
is  considered  to  be  in the public domain.  (The uuname
program will send only the site name and  not  the  entire
contents  of  the  L.sys  file,  thus,  phone  numbers and
passwords are not transmitted.)

この情報を提供するかどうかはサイトの判断に拠ります。...

The purpose of this message is to  generate  and  maintain
UUCP mail routing maps.  Thus, connections over which mail
can be sent using the site!user syntax should be included,
regardless  of whether the link is actually a UUCP link at
the physical level.  If a mail router should  use  it,  it
should   be  included.   Since  all  information  sent  in
response to this message is optional, sites  are  free  to
edit  the  list,  deleting secret or private links they do
not wish to publicise.

**3.7  Version

     version (no arguments)

The name and version of the software running on the  local
system  is  to be mailed back to the author of the article
(Reply-to if present, otherwise From).
