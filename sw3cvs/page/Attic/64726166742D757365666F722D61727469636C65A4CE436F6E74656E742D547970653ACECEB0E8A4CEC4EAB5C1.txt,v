@*draft 05 6.21.2.  Content-Type

The Content-Type: "text/plain" is the default type for any news
article, but the recommendations and limits on line lengths set out
in section 4.5 Ought to be observed

The acceptability of other subtypes of Content-Type: "text" (such as
"text/html") is a matter of policy (see 1.1), and posters Ought Not
to use them unless established policy or custom in the particular
hierarchies or groups involved so allows.  Moreover, even in those
cases, for the benefit of readers who see it only in its transmitted
form, the material SHOULD be "pretty-printed" (for example by
restricting its line length as above and by keeping sequences which
control its layout or style separate from the meaningful text).

Content-Tyoe: 「text」のほかの亜型 (「text/html」など) を認めるか
は方針の問題 (1.1 参照) で、投稿者は関係する特定の階層や集団で
確立されている方針あるいは慣習の認めるところでなければ
使用する''べ''きでは''あ''りません。・・・


   In the same way, Content-Types requiring special processing for their
   display, such as "application", "image", "audio", "video" and
   "multipart/related" are discouraged except in groups specifically
   intended (by policy or custom) to include them. Exceptionally, those
   application types defined in [RFC 1847] and [RFC 2015] and/or [RFC
   2015bis] for use within "multipart/signed" articles, and the type
   "application/pgp-keys" (or other similar types containing digital
   certificates) may be used freely.

   Reading agents SHOULD NOT, unless explicitly configured otherwise,
   act automatically on Application types which could change the state
   of that agent (e.g. by writing or modifying files), except in the
   case of those prescribed for use in control messages (7.2.1.2 and
   7.2.4.1).
