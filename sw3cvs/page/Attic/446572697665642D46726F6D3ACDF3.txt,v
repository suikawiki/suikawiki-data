@*RFC 2068 19.6.2.3 Derived-From

   The Derived-From entity-header field can be used to indicate the
   version tag of the resource from which the enclosed entity was
   derived before modifications were made by the sender. This field is
   used to help manage the process of merging successive changes to a
   resource, particularly when such changes are being made in parallel
   and from multiple sources.

          Derived-From   = "Derived-From" ":" quoted-string

   An example use of the field is:

          Derived-From: "2.1.1"

   The Derived-From field is required for PUT and PATCH requests if the
   entity being sent was previously retrieved from the same URI and a
   Content-Version header was included with the entity when it was last
   retrieved.
