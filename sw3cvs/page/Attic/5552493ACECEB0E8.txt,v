@*HTTP/1.0 ([[RFC1945]])

**D.2.10 URI

   The URI entity-header field may contain some or all of the Uniform
   Resource Identifiers (Section 3.2) by which the Request-URI resource
   can be identified. There is no guarantee that the resource can be
   accessed using the URI(s) specified.


*HTTP/1.1 ([[RFC2068]]) ([[RFC2616]]はあまり使われていないとして説明せず。)

**19.6.2.5 URI

   The URI header field has, in past versions of this specification,
   been used as a combination of the existing Location, Content-Location, 
   and Vary header fields as well as the future Alternates
   field (above). Its primary purpose has been to include a list of
   additional URIs for the resource, including names and mirror
   locations. However, it has become clear that the combination of many
   different functions within this single field has been a barrier to
   consistently and correctly implementing any of those functions.
   Furthermore, we believe that the identification of names and mirror
   locations would be better performed via the Link header field. The
   URI header field is therefore deprecated in favor of those other
   fields.

          URI-header    = "URI" ":" 1#( "<" URI ">" )
