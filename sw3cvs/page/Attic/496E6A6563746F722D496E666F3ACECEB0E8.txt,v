**6.19.  Injector-Info

   The Injector-Info header SHOULD be added to each article by the
   injecting agent in order to provide information as to how that
   article entered the Netnews system and to assist in tracing its true
   origin.

      Injector-Info-content
                          = path-identity

      Injector-Info-header-parameter
                          = posting-host-parameter /
                            posting-account-parameter /
                            posting-sender-parameter /
                            posting-logging-parameter /
                            posting-date-parameter
                            ; for USENET-header-parameters see 4.1
      posting-host-parameter
                          = [CFWS] "posting-host" [CFWS] "=" [CFWS]
                              ( host-value /
                                DQUOTE host-value DQUOTE ) [CFWS]
      host-value          = dot-atom /
                            [ dot-atom ":" ]
                              ( dotted-quad / ; see [RFC 820]
                                ipv6-numeric ) ; see [RFC 2373]
      posting-account-parameter
                          =  [CFWS] "posting-account" [CFWS] "=" value
      posting-sender-parameter
                          = [CFWS] "sender" [CFWS] "=" [CFWS]
                              ( sender-value /
                                DQUOTE sender-value DQUOTE ) [CFWS]
      sender-value        = ( mailbox / "verified" )
      posting-logging-parameter
                          = [CFWS] "logging-data" [CFWS] "=" value
      posting-date-parameter
                          = [CFWS] "posting-date" [CFWS] "=" [CFWS]
                              ( date-value /
                                DQUOTE date-value DQUOTE ) [CFWS]
      date-value          = 1*DIGIT [ ":" date-time ]

   An Injector-Info header MUST NOT be added to an article by any agent
   other than an injecting agent. Any Injector-Info header present when
   an article arrives at an injecting agent MUST be removed. In
   particular if, for some exceptional reason (8.2.2), an article gets
   injected twice, the Injector-Info header will always relate to the
   second injection.

   The path-identity MUST be the same as the path-identity prepended to
   the Path header by that same injecting agent which, following section
   5.6.2, MUST therefore be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
   mailable address.

   Although comments and folding of white space are permitted throughout
   the Injector-Info-content specification, it is RECOMMENDED that
   folding is not used within any header-parameter (but only before or
   after the ";" separating parameters), and that comments are only used
   following the last parameter. It is also RECOMMENDED that such
   parameters as are present are included in the order in which they
   have been defined in the syntax above.  An injecting agent SHOULD use
   a consistent form of this header for all articles emanating from the
   same or similar origins.

        NOTE: The effect of those recommendations is to facilitate the
        recognition of articles arising from certain designated origins
        (as in the so-called "killfiles" which are available in some
        reading agents). Observe that the order within the syntax has
        been chosen to place last those parameters which are most likely
        to change between successive articles posted from the same
        origin.

        NOTE:  To comply with the overall "attribute = value" syntax of
        USENET-header-parameters, any value containing an ipv6-numeric,
        a date-time, a mailbox or any CFWS MUST be quoted using
        <DQUOTE>s (the quoting is optional in other cases).

        NOTE: This header is intended to replace various currently-used
        but nowhere-documented headers such as "NNTP-Posting-Host",
        "NNTP-Posting-Date" amd "X-Trace". Any of these headers present
        when an article arrives at an injecting agent SHOULD also be
        removed as above.

***6.19.1.  Usage of Injector-Info-header-parameters

   The purpose of these parameters is to enable the injecting agent to
   make assertions about the origin of the article, in fulfilment of its
   responsibilities towards the rest of the network as set out in
   section 8.2.  These assertions can then be utilized as follows:

   1. To enable the administrator of the injecting agent to respond to
      complaints and queries concerning the article. For this purpose,
      the parameters included SHOULD be sufficient to enable the
      administrator to identify its true origin (which parameters are
      best suited to this purpose will vary with the nature of the
      injecting site and of its relationship to the posters who use it -
      there is no benefit in including parameters which contribute
      nothing to this aim).  An administrator MAY, with those parameters
      where the syntax so allows, use cryptic notations interpretable
      only by himself if he considers it appropriate to protect the
      privacy of that origin.

   2. To enable relaying, serving and reading agents to recognize
      articles from origins which they might wish to reject, divert, or
      otherwise handle specially, for reasons of site policy.

   3. To enable the timely identification of spews af articles arising
      from a common origin.

   An injecting agent MUST NOT include any Injector-Info-header-
   parameter unless it has positive evidence of its correctness. An
   injecting agent MAY include other-header-parameters with x-token
   attributes which will assist in identifying the origin of the
   article.

      NOTE: It will be observed that the range of parameters provided
      allows much choice as to the precise manner in which an injecting
      agent fulfils its responsibilities. Whilst this standard does not
      seek to establish any preferences in this matter, administrators
      of injecting agents need to be aware of the privacy implications
      of the choices that they make.

****6.19.1.1.  The posting-host-parameter

   If a dot-atom is present, it MUST be a FQDN identifying the specific
   host from which the injecting agent received the article.
   Alternatively, an IP address (dotted-quad or ipv6-numeric) identifies
   that host. If both forms are present, then they MUST identify the
   same host, or at least have done so at the time the article was
   injected.

        NOTE: It is commonly the case that this header identifies a
        dial-up point-of-presence, in which case a posting-account or
        logging-data may need to be consulted to find the true origin of
        the article.

****6.19.1.2.  The posting-account-parameter

   This parameter identifies the source from which the injecting agent
   received the article. It MAY be in a cryptic notation understandable
   only by the administrator of the injecting agent, but it MUST be such
   that a given source always gives rise to the same posting-account (if
   the injecting agent is unable to meet that obligation, then it should
   use a posting-logging-parameter instead).

****6.19.1.3.  The posting-sender-parameter

   This parameter identifies the mailbox of the verified sender of the
   article (alternatively, it uses the token "verified" to indicate that
   at least any addr-spec in the Sender header of the article, or in the
   From header if the Sender header is absent, is correct).

        NOTE: An injecting agent is unlikely to be able to make use of
        this parameter except in cases where it is running on a machine
        which is aware of the user-space in which the posting agent is
        operating. This parameter should be used in preference to a
        posting-account-parameter in such situations.

****6.19.1.4.  The posting-logging-parameter

   This parameter contains information (typically a serial number or a
   session number) which will enable the true origin of the article to
   be determined by reference to logging information kept by the
   injecting agent.

****6.19.1.5.  The posting-date-parameter

   This parameter identifies the time at which the article was injected
   (as distinct from the Date header, which indicates when it was
   written). It is in the form of the number of seconds elapsed since
   January 1st 1970, optionally followed by a date-time which MUST
   indicate the same time.

***6.19.2.  Example

      Injector-Info: news2.isp.net; posting-host=modem-15.pop.isp.net;
         posting-account=client0002623; logging-data=2427;
         posting-date="965243133: Wed 2 Aug 2000 20:05:33 -0100 (BST)"
