@*RFC 2068 19.6.2.2 Content-Version

   The Content-Version entity-header field defines the version tag
   associated with a rendition of an evolving entity. Together with the
   Derived-From field described in section 19.6.2.3, it allows a group
   of people to work simultaneously on the creation of a work as an
   iterative process. The field should be used to allow evolution of a
   particular work along a single path rather than derived works or
   renditions in different representations.

          Content-Version = "Content-Version" ":" quoted-string

   Examples of the Content-Version field include:

          Content-Version: "2.1.2"
          Content-Version: "Fred 19950116-12:26:48"
          Content-Version: "2.5a4-omega7"
