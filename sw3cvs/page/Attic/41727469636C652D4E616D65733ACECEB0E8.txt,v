*          6.17. Article-Names (記事名)

The Article-Names header content indicates any special  significance 
the article may have in particular newsgroups:

Article-Names 頭の中身は特定の新聞組で記事が持っている
特別な意味を示します。

               Article-Names-content  = 1*( name-clause space )
               name-clause            = newsgroup-name ":" article-name
               article-name           = letter 1*( letter / digit / "-" )

          Each  name  clause  specifies  a  newsgroup (which SHOULD be
          among those in the Newsgroups header) and  an  article  name
          local  to  that  newsgroup.   Article  names  MAY be used by
          relayers to file the article in special ways,  or  they  MAY
          just  be  noted  for  possible  special attention by reading
          agents.  Article names are case-sensitive.


               NOTE: This header provides a way to  mark  special
               postings, such as introductions, frequently-asked-
               question lists, etc., so that reading agents  have
               a  way  of  finding them automatically.  The news-
               group name is  specified  for  each  article  name
               because  the  names may be newsgroup-specific; for
               example, many frequently-asked-question lists  are
               posted  to  "news.answers"  in  addition  to their
               "home" newsgroup, and they would not be  known  by
               the same name(s) in both newsgroups.

          The  Article-Names header SHOULD be ignored unless the arti-
          cle also contains an Approved header.

               NOTE: This stipulation is made in anticipation  of
               the  possibility  that  Approved  headers  will be
               involved in cryptographic authentication.

          The presence of an Article-Names header does not necessarily
          imply  that  the  article  will  be  retained unusually long
          before expiration, or that previous article(s) with  similar
          Article-Names  headers  will  be  cancelled  by its arrival.
          Posters preparing special postings SHOULD include  appropri-
          ate  other  headers,  such  as  Expires  and  Supersedes, to
          request such actions.

          Different networks MAY establish different sets  of  article
          names  for the special postings they deem significant; it is
          preferable for usage to  be  standardized  within  networks,
          although  it might be desirable for individual newsgroups to
          have different naming conventions in some situations.  Arti-
          cle  names  MUST  be  14  characters or less.  The following
          names are suggested but are not mandatory:

          intro       Introduction to the newsgroup for newcomers.

          charter     Charter, rules, organization,  moderation  poli-
                      cies, etc.

          background  Biographies  of special participants, history of
                      the newsgroup, notes on related newsgroups, etc.

          subgroups   Descriptions  of sub-newsgroups under this news-
                      group, e.g. "sci.space.news" under  "sci.space".

          facts       Information relating to the purpose of the news-
                      group, e.g. an acronym glossary in  "sci.space".

          references  Where  to get more information: books, journals,
                      FTP repositories, etc.

          faq         Answers to frequently-asked questions.

          menu        If present, a list  of  all  the  other  article
                      names   local  to  this  newsgroup,  with  brief
                      descriptions of their contents.

          Such articles may be divided into subsections using the MIME
          "multipart/mixed"  conventions.  If size considerations make
          it necessary to split  such  articles,  names  ending  in  a
          hyphen  and  a  part  number  are  suggested; for example, a
          three-part frequently-asked-questions list could have  arti-
          cle names "faq-1", "faq-2", and "faq-3".

               NOTE: It is somewhat premature to attempt to stan-
               dardize article names, since this is essentially a
               new  feature  with  no experience behind it.  How-
               ever, if reading agents are to attach special sig-
               nificance to these names, some attempt at standard
               conventions  is  imperative.   This  is  a   first
               attempt at providing some.
