> One browser started ignoring CSS files in one very specific 
case, namely only if the document had a DOCTYPE that, at the time, was 
basically unused. (I was one of the two people pushing for this.) It broke

we still get bug reports about this today, so maybe it wasn't that good an 
idea after all.)
