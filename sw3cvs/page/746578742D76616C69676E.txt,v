>
Vertical Alignment
>
A paragraph of text may be aligned vertically via the use of a text-valign style attribute which is a
non-standard extension to [CSS2].
>
The supported alignments are limited to top, middle, and bottom.
>
Example:
[PRE(HTML example code)[
<p style="text-valign:middle">
  This is the first line of the paragraph.<br />
  This is the second line of the paragraph.<br />
  This is the last line of the paragraph.<br />
</p>
]PRE]
