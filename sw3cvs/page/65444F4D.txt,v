[CITE[eDOM Introduction]] <http://www.playsophy.com/edom/edom.html>

> The w3c DOM lacks many of the methods and objects needed to build document editors. eDOM is a module of editing routines build over the w3c DOM for CSS-enabled XML and XHTML editing in any standards-based browser. Geiko-based browsers like Mozilla are the initial target. First releases tackle text/object manipulation (editing and styling); later releases will address layout editing.
