                    IMP-HOST INTERFACE FLOW DIAGRAMS

The following flow diagrams were extracted from the logic diagrams pro-
vided in Appendix B of BBN Report No. 1822.  These diagrams indicate
the logical sequence of hardware operations which occur within the
IMP-HOST interface.  The logic names appearing in the blocks correspond
to the logic elements found in Appendix B.
