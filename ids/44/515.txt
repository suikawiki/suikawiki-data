> You wouldn’t deliver desktop-sized images to a mobile device, would you? If you are, you’re slowing down mobile users, which can have negative effects on your site performance. We help you counteract this via Clodui support for resizing images using URL parameters and Client-Hint based resize, which allows images to dynamically resize based on the browser and device.
