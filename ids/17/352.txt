>       Transcoding is the process of converting text data from one
character encoding form to another.  Transcoders work only at the
level of character encoding and do not parse the text.  Note:
Transcoding may involve one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many or
many-to-many mappings.  Because some legacy mappings are glyphic,
they may not only be many-to-many, but also discontinuous: thus
XYZ may map to yxz.  <CHARMOD>
>      In this definition, "many-to-one" means a sequence of characters
mapped to a single character.  The "many" does not mean
alternative characters that map to the single character.
