Many ant species use branching
networks of pheromone trails for
orientation between nest and
resources [1&#8211;3]. Ants on trails
make adaptive U-turns for
correcting their course using
visual cues [4,5] or trail geometry
information [2]. However, the role
of seemingly non-corrective
U-turns on trails is poorly
understood. We found that a
minority of ants consistently make
frequent and seemingly
inappropriate U-turns during
foraging bouts. These frequent
U-turners were also highly likely
to lay pheromone trail, whilst nonturners
rarely did so. Our data
suggest that U-turning ants make
a greater contribution to trail
persistence than do non-turners.

We determined the frequency
of U-turning in Pharaoh’s ants
(Monomorium pharaonis) by
following individuals making a
single trip from ramp end to
feeder, or the reverse (Figure 1). If
an ant made a 180o turn and
walked >10 mm, a U-turn was
recorded. Otherwise, a nonturning
ant walked to the nest (if
fed) or found food (if unfed). ‘Fed’
ants left the feeder with a visibly
enlarged gaster. ‘Unfed’ ants
were observed joining the ramp
before walking towards the food.
In some ants, e.g. Lasius niger [6],
fed ants are more likely to lay
pheromone.

We found no significant
differences in U-turning
frequencies (mean = 43.2%, range
= 39.5&#8211;48%) of three study
colonies (Chi square = 1.98,
df = 2, N = 300, P = 0.372). We
therefore pooled data to compare
fed and unfed ants, and found
that 150 fed ants (N = 50 x 3
colonies) and 150 unfed ants
(N = 50 x 3 colonies) performed
U-turns with similar probability,
45.1% and 38% respectively (Chi
square = 1.73, df = 1, N = 300,
P = 0.188). The mean U-turning
frequency (43%) on active
foraging trails was much higher
than that reported by Jackson et
al [2] for individual ants on an
empty trail (~ 7%). The high
frequency may be attributable to
U-turning ants making frequent
U-turns, spending more time on
the trail, and therefore being more
likely to be observed. We noted
that ants making U-turns were
highly likely to make subsequent
U-turns. U-turners also made
significantly fewer contacts with
oncoming ants than did nonturners,
indicating that U-turns
were not due to trail traffic
(U-turners N = 128, mean
contacts = 1.54, SD = 1.86; nonturners
N = 172, mean
contacts = 2.92, SD = 2.58; t test,
t = 4.97, df = 297, P < 0.0001).

We determined individual
fidelity to U-turning behaviour
during a foraging bout, using two
colonies. From each colony 20 fed
and 20 unfed non-turning ants
were returned to their start
position and followed for a further
five such trials. Unfed ants were
replaced at the ramp end, and fed
ants at the food end (Figure 1). If
a non-turner made a U-turn on
any of its five trials, the distance
was recorded, and the ant was
returned to its start position.
Otherwise, an ant was only
returned to its start position after
completing a trial &#8211; that is,
reaching the end opposite to its
start end. Trials were then
conducted on U-turners (again,
N = 20 fed and 20 unfed x 2
colonies) in experiments in which
an ant observed to U-turn on its
first trial was allowed to continue
(often U-turning several times)
until it reached the food (unfed
ants), or the ramp (fed ants). The
cumulative distance walked by
the ant was recorded. If U-turners
returned to their start point, they
were rotated 180o using the
transfer stage.

For comparative purposes, the
number of U-turns per 45 cm (the
trial length) was calculated for
each ant tested. We found that
U-turners scored a mean of 3.20
U-turns per 45cm (SD = 1.92,
N = 80 ants). In contrast, nonturners
(N = 80 ants) performed
on average 0.21 U-turns per
45 cm (SD = 0.33). The difference
in mean score (per trial) was
highly significant (t test: t = &#8211;13.7,
df = 83, P < 0.0001). Individuals
showed high fidelity to U-turning
and non-turning during a foraging
bout (see Supplemental Data for
more on specialisation). In these
experiments, 77/80 ants (96%)
identified as non-turners on their
initial trial were non-turners in
their next trial, whilst 72/80
U-turners (90%) made
subsequent U-turns. We found no
significant differences between
the U-turn frequencies of fed vs.
unfed non-turners from either
colony (colony 1: t = &#8211;0.45,
df = 37, N = 40, P = 0.657; colony
2: t = &#8211;0.94, df = 36, P = 0.356), or
of non-turners in different
colonies (fed and unfed nonturners
pooled for each colony:
t = 1.34, df = 74, P = 0.185). There
were also no differences between
the frequencies of U-turns by fed
vs. unfed U-turners (t = &#8211;0.44,
df = 77, P = 0.663), or by
U-turners in different colonies
(fed and unfed U-turners pooled:
t = &#8211;1.17, df = 75, P = 0.248).

In Lasius niger ants, some
individuals adopt pheromonetrail-
laying postures with very high
frequency [7]. In our final
experiment, we tested the
hypothesis that U-turning ants lay
pheromone trail frequently. We
identified U-turners (N = 50 fed,
N = 50 unfed) and non-turners
(N = 50 fed, N = 50 unfed) from
each of three colonies (total
N = 3 x (2 x 100) = 600) and
observed trail laying behaviour by
isolated individuals. We
categorized U-turners and nonturners
based on performance in a
single trial. Individual ants were
transferred from the walkway onto
smoked glass at the end of the
trial (pheromone trail deposition
by the stinger is visible on
smoked glass in the form of
continuous lines, streaks, or spots
between footprints [2,8,9]). Of
U-turners, 263/300 (87.7%) made
trail markings, whereas among
non-turners, only 67/300 (22.3%)
did so. This difference is highly
significant (Chi-square = 259, df =
1, N = 600, P < 0.0001), and not
affected by colony or nutritional
status (log-linear likelihood
analysis: by colony, G2 = 3.7, df =
4, N = 200 ants x 3 colonies, P =
0.448; by fed vs. unfed, G2 = 2.08,
df = 3, Nfed = 300, Nunfed = 300,
P = 0.556). The fact that 87.7% of
U-turners laid pheromone trail
when walking on smoked glass
indicated that they could be
contributing to the pheromone
trail more frequently than nonturners.
Given their frequent
U-turns, the U-turner minority (7%
in [2]) should spend greater time
on the trail and should have the
opportunity to contribute more
trail pheromone than non-turners.

Our data show that many
U-turns are neither mistakes nor
course corrections, but could be a
vital component of the
pheromone-trail maintenance
process. U-turning ants are well
positioned to make decisions on
trail persistence because by
walking the trails repeatedly, they
continually update their
knowledge of food availability.
This well-informed status
contrasts with that of ants not
making U-turns because nonturners
could easily be
misinformed if they fail to access a
crowded resource. U-turners may
have greater control over
abandonment of exhausted food
sources, or over the switch to
superior food sources. Making
quick foraging decisions is vital to
colony success, and leaving
decision-making to a specialised,
well-informed minority [10] would
certainly speed the process.

Experimental set-up for studying U-turning behaviour in Pharaoh’s ants.

To minimise visual cues, M. pharaonis colonies (1,000&#8211;1,400 workers and 10&#8211;50 queens) where housed in a nest container (test-tube
sheathed in black paper) placed in an opaque open-topped cylindrical container. The 40W diffused tungsten light was suspended 60cm
above the centre to provide non-directional lighting. An access ramp connected the container base to one end of a horseshoe-shaped
plastic walkway (45 cm from ramp to food). The walkway was supported on Fluon-dipped pins, making the ramp the only access route.
The horseshoe shape allowed us to easily manipulate the ant’s direction by transferring them from one walkway arm to the other. As
an ant stepped upon the transfer stage, the ant’s walking direction was reversed by simple lateral transfer of the stage, as shown. This
minimised any disruption to the ant’s progress. Neither lateral transfer nor 180o reversal significantly affected U-turning frequency of
individuals when compared to U-turning frequency of non-manipulated individuals from a control colony (log-linear likelihood analysis:
G2 = 0.56, df = 4, Nmanipulated = 100, Ncontrol = 100, P = 0.967). In trials, colonies were deprived of syrup for at least 2 days, and then given
20 min to form a foraging trail to the feeder, a drop of 1M sucrose. Ants were only tested during the next 60 min, when trail traffic was
high (~70&#8211;100 ants per min).

- Uターンアリがなくなった餌への経路の消去やよりよい餌への経路の切り替えに強い影響力を持っているのかもしれない
- 採飼の決定高速化が巣の存続に重要であり、少数のUターンアリによる意思決定の高速化は理にかなう
