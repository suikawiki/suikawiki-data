*Abstract
This work introduces the concept of a Wireless Underground Sensor Network (WUSN). WUSNs can be used to monitor
a variety of conditions, such as soil properties for agricultural applications and toxic substances for environmental
monitoring. Unlike existing methods of monitoring underground conditions, which rely on buried sensors connected
via wire to the surface, WUSN devices are deployed completely belowground and do not require any wired connections.
Each device contains all necessary sensors, memory, a processor, a radio, an antenna, and a power source. This makes their
deployment much simpler than existing underground sensing solutions. Wireless communication within a dense substance
such as soil or rock is, however, significantly more challenging than through air. This factor, combined with the necessity
to conserve energy due to the difficulty of unearthing and recharging WUSN devices, requires that communication protocols
be redesigned to be as efficient as possible. This work provides an extensive overview of applications and design
challenges for WUSNs, challenges for the underground communication channel including methods for predicting path
losses in an underground link, and challenges at each layer of the communication protocol stack.
