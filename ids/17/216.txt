>       Informational Note: The term "fully qualified domain name" is not
>       well defined.  In '''['''RFC1034''']''', it is also called an absolute domain
>       name, and the two terms are associated in '''['''RFC1535''']'''.  The earliest
>       use of the term can be found in '''['''RFC1123''']'''.  References to those
>       older specifications ought not to be construed as limiting the
>       characters of a fully qualified domain name to the ASCII range;
>       for example, '''['''RFC5890''']''' mentions that a fully qualified domain name
>       can contain one or more U-labels.

> 
>    Fully qualified domain name (FQDN):  This is often just a clear way
>       of saying the same thing as "domain name of a node", as outlined
>       above.  However, the term is ambiguous.  Strictly speaking, a
>       fully qualified domain name would include every label, including
>       the final, zero-length label of the root: such a name would be
>       written "www.example.net." (note the terminating dot).  But
>       because every name eventually shares the common root, names are
>       often written relative to the root (such as "www.example.net") and
>       are still called "fully qualified".  This term first appeared in
>       '''['''RFC819''']'''.  In this document, names are often written relative to
>       the root.
>       The need for the term "fully qualified domain name" comes from the
>       existence of partially qualified domain names, which are names
>       where some of the right-most names are left off and are understood
>       only by context.
