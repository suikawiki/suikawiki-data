:language identification:Specification of the human language used for a string of text. <NONE>
>     Some protocols (such as MIME and HTTP) allow text that is meant
for machine processing to be identified with the language used in
the text.  Such identification is important for machine-processing
of the text, such as by systems that render the text by speaking
it.  Language identification is also called "language tagging".
