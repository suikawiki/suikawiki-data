:transcription:
The process of systematically writing the sounds of some passage
of spoken language, generally with the use of a technical phonetic
alphabet (usually Latin-based) or other systematic transcriptional
orthography.  Transcription also sometimes refers to the
conversion of written text into a transcribed (usually Latin-
based) form, based on the sound of the text as if it had been
spoken.  <NONE>
>Unlike transliterations, which are generally designed to be
round-trip convertible, transcriptions of written material are
almost never round-trip convertible to their original form.
