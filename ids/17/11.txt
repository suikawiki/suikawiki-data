*ABSTRACT
Wireless sensor networks consist of small
nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless
communications capabilities. Many routing,
power management, and data dissemination protocols
have been specifically designed for WSNs
where energy awareness is an essential design
issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ
depending on the application and network architecture.
In this article we present a survey of
state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We
first outline the design challenges for routing
protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive
survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing
techniques are classified into three categories
based on the underlying network
structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based
routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be
classified into multipath-based, query-based,
negotiation-based, QoS-based, and coherentbased
depending on the protocol operation. We
study the design trade-offs between energy and
communication overhead savings in every routing
paradigm. We also highlight the advantages
and performance issues of each routing technique.
The article concludes with possible future
research areas.
