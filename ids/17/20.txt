*ABSTRACT

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are communication networks built
up of a collection of mobile devices which can communicate
through wireless connections. Routing is the task of
directing data packets from a source node to a given destination.
This task is particulary hard in Mobile Ad Hoc
Networks: due to the mobility of the network elements and
the lack of central control, routing algorithms should be
robust and adaptive and work in a decentralized and selforganizing
way. In this paper, we describe an algorithm
which draws inspiration from Swarm Intelligence to obtain
these characteristics. More specifically, we borrow ideas
from ant colonies and from the Ant Colony Optimization
framework. In an extensive set of simulation tests, we compare
our routing algorithm with a state-of-the-art algorithm,
and show that it gets better performance over a wide range
of different scenarios and for a number of different evaluation
measures. In particular, we show that it scales better
with the number of nodes in the network.
