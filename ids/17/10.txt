*Abstract

A combination of distributed computation, positive feedback and constructive greedy
heuristic is proposed as a new approach to stochastic optimization and problem solving.
Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of very good solutions, distributed computation
avoids premature convergence, and greedy heuristic helps the procedure to find acceptable
solutions in the early stages of the search process. An application of the proposed methodology
to the classical travelling salesman problem shows that the system can rapidly provide very
good, if not optimal, solutions. We report on many simulation results and discuss the working
of the algorithm. Some hints about how this approach can be applied to a variety of
optimization problems are also given.
