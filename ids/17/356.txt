:undisplayable character:
A character that has no displayable form.  <NONE>
>
For instance, the zero-width space (U+200B) cannot be displayed
because it takes up no horizontal space.  Formatting characters
such as those for setting the direction of text are also
undisplayable.  Note, however, that every character in [UNICODE]
has a glyph associated with it, and that the glyphs for
undisplayable characters are enclosed in a dashed square as an
indication that the actual character is undisplayable.
