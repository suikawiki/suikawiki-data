:transliteration:
The process of representing the characters of an alphabetical or
syllabic system of writing by the characters of a conversion
alphabet.  <NONE>
>     Many script transliterations are exact, and many have perfect
round-trip mappings.  The notable exception to this is
[[romanization]], described above.  Transliteration involves
converting text expressed in one script into another script,
generally on a letter-by-letter basis.
