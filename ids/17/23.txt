*Abstract

A biologically inspired algorithm is presented to
route messages in mobile wireless ad-hoc networks. The principles
of swarm intelligence are used to define a probabilistic
algorithm for which routing through paths of maximum
throughput is an emergent property. This adaptive algorithm,
dubbed Termite, uses stigmergy to reduce the amount of control
traffic needed to maintain a high data goodput. Stigmergy is a
process by which information is indirectly communicated between
individuals through their environment. The Termite environment
is the contents of all routing tables. The movement of packets is
influenced at each node, and communicating nodes observe this
influence to update their own tables. Strong routing robustness is
achieved through the use of multiple paths; each packet is routed
randomly and independently.

*既存アリルーティングとの関係

There exists relatively little work with regards to biologically
inspired algorithms for routing in communications
networks. However, there are a number of notable examples
which show that these concepts can provide a significant performance
gain over traditional approaches. In general, mobile
agents travel the network while updating each visited node
with routing information. Another major feature is the use of
stigmergy. The following paragraphs describe a number of the
most prominent algorithms in this field.

**a) Ant-Based Control

Ant-Based Control (ABC) is a
routing algorithm for circuit-switched networks which routes
calls based on the local interaction of mobile agents [4].
Mobile agents (ant packets) traverse the network, updating
routing tables at each node depending on the current state
of the routing table as well as the age of the packet. Routing
tables consist of next hop probabilities for each destination.
Ants traveling in one direction influence the placement of calls
in the opposite direction.

**b) AntNet

AntNet is a more recent approach to using
the social insect analogy to solve routing problems in wired
networks [1]. It is presented as a distributed, scalable, and
responsive algorithm for routing in wired networks. The algorithm
is improved upon in [2]. Each node periodically sends
a forward ant packet to a random destination. The forward
ant records its path as well as the time needed to arrive at
each intermediate node. The timing information recorded by
the forward ant, which is forwarded with the same priority
as data traffic, is returned from the destination to the source
by means of a high priority backward ant. Each intermediate
node updates its routing tables with the information from
the backward ant. Routing tables contain per destination next
hop biases. In this way, faster routes are used with greater
likelihood.

**c) Mobile Ants Based Routing

Mobile Ants Based Routing
(MABR) is introduced as the first routing algorithm for
MANETs inspired by social insects [3]. The approach presented
in AntNet is extended to ad-hoc networks by abstracting
the network into logical links and nodes based on relative
node location. Location data is assumed from positioning
devices. An optimized greedy routing algorithm is used to
forward messages between logical nodes. Unfortunately no
performance data is available for this protocol at the time of
this writing.

**d) Ant-Colony Based Routing Algorithm

This algorithm
(ARA) presents a detailed routing scheme for MANETs,
including route discovery and maintenance mechanisms [5].
Route discovery is achieved by flooding forward ants to the
destination while establishing reverse links to the source.
A similar mechanism is employed other algorithms such as
AODV. Routes are maintained primarily by data packets as
they flow through the network. In the case of a route failure,
an attempt is made to send the packet over an alternate
link. Otherwise, it is returned to the previous hop for similar
processing. A new route discovery sequence is launched if the
packet is eventually returned to the source.

**e) Termite

This paper presents an alternative perspective
on the MANET routing problem than that suggested by
MABR. Termite expands on the algorithm used by ABC, but
does away with the idea that only specialized packets may
update routing tables. AntNet is a related algorithm, although
its forward/backward ant feature is not used. Termite and ARA
share nearly the same data routing mechanism, although they
differ significantly with regards to route discovery and failure
recovery.
