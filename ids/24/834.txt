> To force success, the alf-force-success-response header is set on the HTTP request whose value is always set to true. For example, to force a success response status for a request to retrieve children of a folder that does not exist, you would type the following in the command line:
> curl -uadmin:admin -v -H "alf-force-success-response:true" "http://localhost:8080/alfresco/s/cmis/p/doesnotexist"
> Although the response status code is 200 (which means Success), the body of the response will still represent a failure and include details such as the real status code (in this case, 404, which means Not Found) and an error message.
