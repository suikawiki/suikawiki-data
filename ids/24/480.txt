> URI based on the URN in the type field. The URN is encoded into the NDEF type field in a shortened form: <domain_name>:<service_name>. Android maps this to a URI in the form: vnd.android.nfc://ext/<domain_name>:<service_name>.

> Note: URNs for TNF_EXTERNAL_TYPE have a canonical format of: urn:nfc:ext:example.com:externalType, however the NFC Forum RTD specification declares that the urn:nfc:ext: portion of the URN must be ommitted from the NDEF record. So all you need to provide is the domain (example.com in the example) and type (externalType in the example) separated by a colon. When dispatching TNF_EXTERNAL_TYPE, Android converts the urn:nfc:ext:example.com:externalType URN to a vnd.android.nfc://ext/example.com:externalType URI, which is what the intent filter in the example declares.
