> BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Earlier drafts of this specification used a subparameter called trust. This has been deprecated in favor of new subparameters for each trusted resolution option, i.e., https=true and saml=true. However, implementations SHOULD consider the following values equivalent both for the purpose of service endpoint selection within XRDS documents and as HTTP(S) Accept header values in XRI authority resolution requests:
>       application/xrds+xml
>       application/xrds+xml;trust=none
>       application/xrds+xml;https=false
>       application/xrds+xml;saml=false
>       application/xrds+xml;https=false;saml=false
>       application/xrds+xml;saml=false;https=false
