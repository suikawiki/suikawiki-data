> OV (organization validation)
> certificates containing an Organization (O) attribute with a value apparently corresponding to an actual organizational entity (i.e., as opposed to a value like "Not validated"), for which the CA is makes claims (e.g., in the CPS) that it has in some way validated that that value corresponds to the organizational identity of the certificate subscriber.
