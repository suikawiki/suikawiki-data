> Between January 2009 and January 2011, we offered a service known as the Interim Trust Anchor Repository (ITAR). It provided a mechanism to disseminate the delegation signer records for top-level domains.
> This service was superseded by the signed DNS root zone in July 2010. All delegation signer records were removed from the ITAR later in 2010, with the service finally being decommissioned in January 2011.
