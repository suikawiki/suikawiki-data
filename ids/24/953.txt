> Opera Reader, which implements CSS3 extensions that allow content to be split into pages. These pages can be turned in a natural manner through gestures rather than point and click, figures can be floated to the top and bottom of pages, and the documents have a sense of themselves and their environment; they know about documents above, below and on the sides. The new CSS features are described in the CSS Generated Content for Paged Media module.
