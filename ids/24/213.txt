> In Netscape Communicator 4.x browsers, the preferred mechanism for installing plugins was SmartUpdate, which involved signed JAR files (rather like signed CAB files in IE) and JavaScript as the installer-language.  This delivery mechanism allowed plugins to be delivered dynamically to end-users, without necessitating a departure from the browser or without restarting the browser.  But SmartUpdate is no longer supported in Netscape Gecko-based browsers.  Instead, the technology that replaces it is XPInstall (also abbreviated as XPI and pronounced "zippy").  XPInstall is capable of doing everything SmartUpdate could do in Netscape Communicator 4.x
