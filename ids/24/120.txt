> The referenced SVG file MAY be provided in GZIP-compressed '''['''RFC1952''']'''
>    form as an SVGZ file.  In this case, the extension 'svgz' is used as
>    an alias for 'svg.gz' '''['''RFC1952''']''', i.e., octet streams of type
>    image/svg+xml, subsequently compressed with gzip as specified in
>    '''['''SVGR''']'''.  The hash over the SVGZ file is calculated over the
>    decompressed SVG content with canonicalized EOL characters (<LF>) as
>    specified above.
>    When the SVG image is embedded using the "data" URL scheme as defined
>    in Section 4, SVG image data MUST be provided in SVGZ (GZIP
>    compressed) form (i.e., it MUST NOT be provided in uncompressed SVG
>    form).
