> DV (domain validation)
> certificates containing a Common Name (CN) attribute or Subject Alternative Name extension with a value (or values) apparently corresponding to one or more actual Internet domains, for which the CA makes claims (e.g., in the CPS) that it has in some way validated that the domain(s) in question are owned and/or legitimately controlled by the cert subscriber, and for which the CA makes no claims as to the validity of any organizational identity stored in the Organization attribute of the certificate.
