> NPGPX - the GPX plugin
> NPGPX is a plugin that loads and displays GPX files directly in your browser window. It supports zooming and panning, as well as simple graphical settings. It should work with Mozilla and Mozilla-like browsers such as Firefox or Netscape.
> GPX, or the GPS eXchange format, is an XML-based file format that is designed to store GPS data - waypoints, routes, and tracks. It is used by many GPS programs, for example Quantum GIS and GPSBabel. The specification of the GPX format, and other useful documentation, can be found here.
