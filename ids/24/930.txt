> But then, we should not use "incubation" as a euphemism for "no one is going to implement this and we don't want it" as it demeans the work of groups like the WIGC - that actually do incubation. At least, I will strongly object to the use of that word if your intention is to kill the spec. 
> So, what then is the real reason for WP terminating work on the spec? Can we see the minutes from the rationale given to the AC?
