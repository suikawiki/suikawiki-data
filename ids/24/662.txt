> This proposal introduces an Observable type to the ECMAScript standard library. The Observable type can be used to model push-based data sources such as DOM events, timer intervals, and sockets. In addition, observables are:
> Compositional: Observables can be composed with higher-order combinators.
> Lazy: Observables do not start emitting data until an observer has subscribed.
> Integrated with ES6: Data is sent to consumers using the ES6 generator interface.
