> Today we released The Hit List for iPhone v2.1, which adds support for a custom URL scheme.
> The scheme enables other apps to trigger the creation of a new task. It's also fully available on the Mac. So for example, on a device with The Hit List installed, opening this URL:
> thehitlist:///inbox/tasks?method=POST&title=Test
> will start creating a new task with the title "Test". (You can of course then edit the title to something more appropriate — it's just a starting point!)
