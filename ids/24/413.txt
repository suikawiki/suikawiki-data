> Website owners must declare associations with apps to establish an app link. The site owner declares the relationship to an app by hosting a JSON file, named statements.json, at the well-known location on the domain:
> http://<domain>:<optional port>/.well-known/statements.json
> Note: During the M Developer Preview period, the JSON file is verified via http protocol. For the official release of the platform, the file is verified over encrypted, https protocol.
