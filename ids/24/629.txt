> When an ActiveX control without a User-Interface is inserted into a page in Source view, or when Source view is activated for a page that contains a control without a User-Interface, an error message box appears that states the following:
> >An object has failed to load. The object will be displayed as text.
> Source view is attempting to render the control graphically but cannot because the control has not defined a design-time graphical interface for itself.
> When a control without a User-Interface is inserted into a page in Source view from the Toolbox, the error message cannot be avoided. 
> To avoid receiving the error message whenever you switch to Source view, add an attribute called "viewastext" to the <object> tag that defines the ActiveX control that does not have a User-Interface. This will prevent Source view from attempting to render the control graphically, for example:
>    <OBJECT VIEWASTEXT CLASSID="clsid:B0A6BAE2-AAF0-11D0-A152-00A0C908DB96"
>    ID=SequencerControl1>
