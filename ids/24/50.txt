> This site provides a collection of schemas that are used to describe concepts, entities, and relationships for bibliographic and cultural heritage resources and collections, in libraries and associated domains. As an extension to schema.org, BiblioGraph.net adds terms and entities that are particularly relevant and important within these more specific domains.
