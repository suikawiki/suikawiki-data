>  LDP Paging servers communicating order must specify the order using a HTTP Link header whose context URI is the page URI, whose link relation is http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#pageSequence, and whose target IRI identifies a LDP-RS whose content includes the sort criteria. The resource identified by the Link header's target IRI must contain a triple whose subject is the Link header's target IRI, whose predicate is ldp:pageSortCriteria and whose object is a page sort criteria resource compliant with this section's requirements on its content.
