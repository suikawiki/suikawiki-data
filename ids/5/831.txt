[[ange-ftp]] というのは [[Emacs]] で動作する [[FTP]] ソフトウェアがあるらしい。それのこと?
このよくある書式の発祥はそのソフトだったのだろうか?

Any substring of a filename matching one of the REGEXPs is replaced by
the corresponding STRING using `replace-match', not treating STRING
literally.  All pairs are applied in the order given.  The default
value converts ange-ftp/EFS-style paths into ftp URLs and prepends
`file:' to any path beginning with `/'.

For example, adding to the default a specific translation of an ange-ftp

> ffap is a powerful package which extends the find-file command (the one which prompts for a file name in the minibuffer, normally bound to C-x C-f). It searches the text around the cursor position for something which might represent a filename -- a file in the current directory, a C #included file, a newsgroup reference, an ange-ftp style reference to a file on a remote machine or an URL -- and prompts you either to open that file, or to send the URL to a browser (via browse-url). Once experiencing this you quickly get sick of typing filenames into the minibuffer, and may find yourself inserting ``hyperlinks'' in strategic places in your files to save typing. ffap is distributed with both Emacs and XEmacs; I bind it to the F3 key as follows :
