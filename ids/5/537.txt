**RFC 2046 5.1.5.  Digest Subtype

   This document defines a "digest" subtype of the "multipart" Content-
   Type.  This type is syntactically identical to "multipart/mixed", but
   the semantics are different.  In particular, in a digest, the default
   Content-Type value for a body part is changed from "text/plain" to
   "message/rfc822".  This is done to allow a more readable digest
   format that is largely compatible (except for the quoting convention)
   with RFC 934.

Note: Though it is possible to specify a Content-Type value for a
body part in a digest which is other than "message/rfc822", such as a
"text/plain" part containing a description of the material in the
digest, actually doing so is undesireble. The "multipart/digest"
Content-Type is intended to be used to send collections of messages.
If a "text/plain" part is needed, it should be included as a seperate
part of a "multipart/mixed" message.

A digest in this format might, then, look something like this:
