> The mission of the Bible Technologies Group is to maximize production, distribution, access, use, impact, and preservation of the Bible and related materials from all time periods.&#194; Co-sponsored by the American Bible Society and the Society of Biblical Literature, the OSIS initiative plays a key role in meeting this goal by providing a common format to facilitate production, distribution, etc. of the Bible and related materials.&#194; Since people engage with the Bible at a number of levels - as literature, as a religious text, etc. - OSIS is "''a common format for many visions.''"
