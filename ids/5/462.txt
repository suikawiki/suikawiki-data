*[DEL[5]] [INS[4.]] The Byte Order Mark (BOM) and Conversions to/from [INS[the]] UTF-16 [INS[Charset]] [INS[バイト順マーク (BOM) 及び UTF-16 [INS[charset]] への又は UTF-16 [INS[charset]] からの変換]]

   [DEL[The XML Recommendation, in section]] [INS[Section]] 4.3.3[DEL[,]] [INS[of [XML] ]] specifies that [DEL[UTF-16]] XML [INS[MIME]] entities
   [INS[in the charset "utf-16" MUST]] [DEL[must]] begin with a byte order mark (BOM), which is [DEL[the ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE character,]] [INS[a]]
   hexadecimal [INS[octet]] sequence [DEL[0xFEFF]] [INS[0xFE 0xFF]] (or [DEL[0xFFFE]] [INS[0xFF 0xFE]], depending on
   endian).  The XML Recommendation further states that the BOM is an
   encoding signature, and is not part of either the markup or the
   character data of the XML document.

   Due to [INS[the presence of]] the BOM, applications [DEL[which]] [INS[that]] convert [DEL[the UTF-16 encoding]] [INS[XML from "utf-16"]] to [DEL[another]] [INS[a non-Unicode]] encoding [DEL[SHOULD]] [INS[MUST]] strip the BOM before
   conversion.  Similarly, when converting from another encoding into
   [DEL[UTF-16]] [INS["utf-16"]], the BOM [DEL[SHOULD]] [INS[MUST]] be added after conversion is complete.

[INS[
>In addition to the charset "utf-16", [RFC2781] introduces "utf-16le"
(little endian) and "utf-16be" (big endian) as well.  The BOM is
prohibited for these charsets.  When an XML MIME entity is encoded in
"utf-16le" or "utf-16be", it MUST NOT begin with the BOM but SHOULD
contain an encoding declaration.  Conversion from "utf-16" to "utf-
16be" or "utf-16le" and conversion in the other direction MUST strip
or add the BOM, respectively.

*5. Fragment Identifiers
>Section 4.1 of [RFC2396] notes that the semantics of a fragment
identifier (the part of a URI after a "#") is a property of the data
resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and
interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type
of the retrieval result.

[[RFC 2396]] の4.1節は、[[素片識別子]] ([[URI]] の
[CODE(URI)[#]] の後の部分) の意味は[[取出し]]動作の結果得られるデータの[[特性]]であり、
素片識別子の書式と解釈は取出し結果の[[媒体型]]に依存すると注記しています。

>As of today, no established specifications define identifiers for XML
media types.  However, a working draft published by W3C, namely "XML
Pointer Language (XPointer)", attempts to define fragment identifiers
for text/xml and application/xml.  The current specification for
XPointer is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr.

*6. The Base URI
>Section 5.1 of [RFC2396] specifies that the semantics of a relative
URI reference embedded in a MIME entity is dependent on the base URI.
The base URI is either (1) the base URI embedded in the MIME entity,
(2) the base URI of the encapsulating MIME entity, (3) the URI used
to retrieve the MIME entity, or (4) the application-dependent default
base URI, where (1) has the highest precedence.  [RFC2396] further
specifies that the mechanism for embedding the base URI is dependent
on the media type.
>As of today, no established specifications define mechanisms for
embedding the base URI in XML MIME entities.  However, a Proposed
Recommendation published by W3C, namely "XML Base", attempts to
define such a mechanism for text/xml, application/xml, 
text/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-external-parsed-entity.
The current specification for XML Base is available at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase>.

*7. A Naming Convention for XML-Based Media Types
>This document recommends the use of a naming convention (a suffix of
'+xml') for identifying XML-based MIME media types, whatever their
particular content may represent.  This allows the use of generic XML
processors and technologies on a wide variety of different XML
document types at a minimum cost, using existing frameworks for media
type registration.
>Although the use of a suffix was not considered as part of the
original MIME architecture, this choice is considered to provide the
most functionality with the least potential for interoperability
problems or lack of future extensibility.  The alternatives to the '
+xml' suffix and the reason for its selection are described in
Appendix A.
>As XML development continues, new XML document types are appearing
rapidly.  Many of these XML document types would benefit from the
identification possibilities of a more specific MIME media type than
text/xml or application/xml can provide, and it is likely that many
new media types for XML-based document types will be registered in
the near and ongoing future.
>While the benefits of specific MIME types for particular types of XML
documents are significant, all XML documents share common structures
and syntax that make possible common processing.
> Some areas where 'generic' processing is useful include:

   o  Browsing - An XML browser can display any XML document with a
      provided [CSS] or [XSLT] style sheet, whatever the vocabulary of
      that document.

   o  Editing - Any XML editor can read, modify, and save any XML
      document.

   o  Fragment identification - XPointers (work in progress) can work
      with any XML document, whatever vocabulary it uses and whether or
      not it uses XPointer for its own fragment identification.

   o  Hypertext linking - XLink (work in progress) hypertext linking is
      designed to connect any XML documents, regardless of vocabulary.

   o  Searching - XML-oriented search engines, web crawlers, agents, and
      query tools should be able to read XML documents and extract the
      names and content of elements and attributes even if the tools are
      ignorant of the particular vocabulary used for elements and
      attributes.

   o  Storage - XML-oriented storage systems, which keep XML documents
      internally in a parsed form, should similarly be able to process,
      store, and recreate any XML document.

   o  Well-formedness and validity checking - An XML processor can
      confirm that any XML document is well-formed and that it is valid
      (i.e., conforms to its declared DTD or Schema).

   When a new media type is introduced for an XML-based format, the name
   of the media type SHOULD end with '+xml'.  This convention will allow
   applications that can process XML generically to detect that the MIME
   entity is supposed to be an XML document, verify this assumption by
   invoking some XML processor, and then process the XML document
   accordingly.  Applications may match for types that represent XML
   MIME entities by comparing the subtype to the pattern '*/*+xml'.  (Of
   course, 4 of the 5 media types defined in this document -- text/xml,
   application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity, and
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity -- also represent XML MIME
   entities while not conforming to the '*/*+xml' pattern.)

      NOTE: Section 14.1 of HTTP[RFC2616] does not support Accept
      headers of the form "Accept: */*+xml" and so this header MUST NOT
      be used in this way.  Instead, content negotiation[RFC2703] could
      potentially be used if an XML-based MIME type were needed.

   XML generic processing is not always appropriate for XML-based media
   types.  For example, authors of some such media types may wish that
   the types remain entirely opaque except to applications that are
   specifically designed to deal with that media type.  By NOT following
   the naming convention '+xml', such media types can avoid XML-generic
   processing.  Since generic processing will be useful in many cases,
   however -- including in some situations that are difficult to predict
   ahead of time -- those registering media types SHOULD use the '+xml'
   convention unless they have a particularly compelling reason not to.

   The registration process for these media types is described in
   [RFC2048].  The registrar for the IETF tree will encourage new XML-
   based media type registrations in the IETF tree to follow this
   guideline.  Registrars for other trees SHOULD follow this convention
   in order to ensure maximum interoperability of their XML-based
   documents.  Similarly, media subtypes that do not represent XML MIME
   entities MUST NOT be allowed to register with a '+xml' suffix.

**7.1 Referencing

   Registrations for new XML-based media types under the top-level type
   "text" SHOULD, in specifying the charset parameter and encoding
   considerations, define them as: "Same as [charset parameter /
   encoding considerations] of text/xml as specified in RFC 3023."

   Registrations for new XML-based media types under top-level types
   other than "text" SHOULD, in specifying the charset parameter and
   encoding considerations, define them as: "Same as [charset parameter
   / encoding considerations] of application/xml as specified in RFC
   3023."

   The use of the charset parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this
   information can be used by XML processors to determine
   authoritatively the charset of the XML MIME entity.

   These registrations SHOULD specify that the XML-based media type
   being registered has all of the security considerations described in
   RFC 3023 plus any additional considerations specific to that media
   type.
>These registrations SHOULD also make reference to RFC 3023 in
specifying magic numbers, fragment identifiers, base URIs, and use of
the BOM.
>These registrations MAY reference the text/xml registration in RFC
3023 in specifying interoperability considerations, if these
considerations are not overridden by issues specific to that media
type.

*[DEL[6]] [INS[8.]] Examples
>The examples below give the value of the [INS[MIME]] Content-type [DEL[MIME]] header and
the XML declaration (which includes the encoding declaration) inside
the XML [INS[MIME]] entity.  For UTF-16 examples, the Byte Order Mark
character is denoted as "{BOM}", and the XML declaration is assumed
to come at the beginning of the XML [INS[MIME]] entity, immediately
following the BOM.  Note that other MIME headers may be present, and
the XML [INS[MIME]] entity may contain other data in addition to the XML
declaration; the examples focus on the Content-type header and the
encoding declaration for clarity.
**[DEL[6]][INS[8]].1 Text/xml with UTF-8 Charset

   Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

   This is the recommended charset value for use with text/xml.  Since
   the charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors [DEL[must]] [INS[MUST]] treat
   the enclosed entity as UTF-8 encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g., SMTP[INS[[RFC0821] ]]), the XML [INS[MIME]]
   entity [DEL[must]] [INS[MUST]] use a content-transfer-encoding of either 
   quoted-printable or base64.  For an 8-bit clean transport (e.g., [DEL[ESMTP, ]]8BITMIME
   [INS[ESMTP]] or NNTP), or a binary clean transport (e.g., HTTP)[INS[,]] no
   content-transfer-encoding is necessary.

**[DEL[6]][INS[8]].2 Text/xml with UTF-16 Charset

   Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-16"

   {BOM}<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-16'?>

[INS[
   or

   {BOM}<?xml version='1.0'?>

]INS]

>This is possible only when the XML [INS[MIME]] entity is transmitted via
HTTP, which uses a MIME-like mechanism and is a binary-clean
protocol, hence does not perform CR and LF transformations and allows
NUL octets.  [DEL[This differs from typical text MIME type processing (see section 19.4.1 of HTTP 1.1 [RFC-2068] for details).]] [INS[As described in [RFC2781], the UTF-16 family MUST NOT be used with media types under the top-level type "text" except over HTTP (see section 19.4.1 of [RFC2616] for details).]]
>Since HTTP is binary clean, no content-transfer-encoding is
necessary.

**8.3 Text/xml with UTF-16BE Charset

   Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-16be"

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-16be'?>

>Observe that the BOM does not exist.  This is again possible only
when the XML MIME entity is transmitted via HTTP.
]INS]

*[DEL[6.3]] [INS[8.4]] Text/xml with ISO-2022-KR Charset

   Content-type: text/xml; charset="iso-2022-kr"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding='iso-2022-kr'?>

   This example shows text/xml with a Korean charset (e.g., Hangul)
   encoded following the specification in [RFC[DEL[-]]1557].  Since the charset
   parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors [DEL[must]] [INS[MUST]] treat the
   enclosed entity as encoded per [DEL[[RFC-1557] ]] [INS[RFC 1557]].

   Since ISO-2022-KR has been defined to use only 7 bits of data, no
   content-transfer-encoding is necessary with any transport.

*[DEL[6.4]] [INS[8.5]] Text/xml with Omitted Charset

   Content-type: text/xml

   {BOM}<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>

[INS[
>or

   {BOM}<?xml version="1.0"?>

]INS]

   This example shows text/xml with the charset parameter omitted.  In
   this case, MIME and XML processors [DEL[must]] [INS[MUST]] assume the charset is "us-ascii", the default charset value for text media types specified in
   [RFC[DEL[-]]2046].  The default of "us-ascii" holds even if the text/xml
   entity is transported using HTTP.

   Omitting the charset parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED for text/xml.  For
   example, even if the contents of the XML [INS[MIME]] entity are UTF-16 or
   UTF-8, or the XML [INS[MIME]] entity has an explicit encoding declaration,
   XML and MIME processors [DEL[must]] [INS[[MUST]] assume the charset is "us-ascii".

**[DEL[6.5]] [INS[8.6]] Application/xml with UTF-16 Charset

[INS[
   Content-type: application/xml; charset="utf-16"

   {BOM}<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>

>or
]INS]
   {BOM}<?xml version="1.0"?>

   This is a recommended charset value for use with application/xml.
   Since the charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors [DEL[must]] [INS[MUST]]
   treat the enclosed entity as UTF-16 encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g., SMTP) or an 8-bit clean
   transport (e.g., [DEL[ESMTP,]] 8BITMIME [INS[ESMTP]] or NNTP), the XML [INS[MIME]] entity [DEL[must]] [INS[MUST]] be
   encoded in quoted-printable or base64.  For a binary clean transport
   (e.g., HTTP), no content-transfer-encoding is necessary.

[INS[
8.7 Application/xml with UTF-16BE Charset

   Content-type: application/xml; charset="utf-16be"

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-16be'?>

   Observe that the BOM does not exist.  Since the charset parameter is
   provided, MIME and XML processors MUST treat the enclosed entity as
   UTF-16BE encoded.

]INS]

**[DEL[6.6]] [INS[8.8]] Application/xml with ISO-2022-KR Charset

   Content-type: application/xml; charset="iso-2022-kr"

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-2022-kr"?>

   This example shows application/xml with a Korean charset (e.g.,
   Hangul) encoded following the specification in [RFC[DEL[-]]1557].  Since the
   charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors [DEL[must]] [INS[MUST]] treat the
   enclosed entity as encoded per [DEL[[RFC-1557] ]] [INS[RFC 1557]], independent of whether the
   XML [INS[MIME]] entity has an internal encoding declaration (this example
   does show such a declaration, which agrees with the charset
   parameter).

   Since ISO-2022-KR has been defined to use only 7 bits of data, no
   content-transfer-encoding is necessary with any transport.

**[DEL[6.7]] [INS[8.9]] Application/xml with Omitted Charset and UTF-16 XML [INS[MIME]] Entity

   Content-type: application/xml

[INS[
   {BOM}<?xml version='1.0' encoding="utf-16"?>

>or
]INS]
   {BOM}<?xml version='1.0'?>

   For this example, the XML [INS[MIME]] entity begins with a BOM.  Since the
   charset has been omitted, a conforming XML processor follows the
   requirements of [[DEL[REC-]]XML], section 4.3.3.  Specifically, the XML
   processor reads the BOM, and thus knows deterministically that the
   charset [DEL[encoding]] is UTF-16.

   An XML-unaware MIME processor [DEL[should]] [INS[SHOULD]] make no assumptions about the
   charset of the XML [INS[MIME]] entity.

**[DEL[6.8]] [INS[8.10]] Application/xml with Omitted Charset and UTF-8 Entity

   Content-type: application/xml

   <?xml version='1.0'?>

   In this example, the charset parameter has been omitted, and there is
   no BOM.  Since there is no BOM, the XML processor follows the
   requirements in section 4.3.3 [INS[of [XML] ]], and optionally applies the
   mechanism described in Appendix F (which is non-normative) of [[DEL[REC-]]XML]
   to determine the charset encoding of UTF-8.  The XML [INS[MIME]] entity does
   not contain an encoding declaration, but since the encoding is UTF-8,
   this is still a conforming XML [INS[MIME]] entity.

   An XML-unaware MIME processor [DEL[should]] [INS[SHOULD]] make no assumptions about the
   charset of the XML [INS[MIME]] entity.

**[DEL[6.9]] [INS[8.11]] Application/xml with Omitted Charset and Internal Encoding Declaration

   Content-type: application/xml

[DEL[
   <?xml version='1.0' encoding="ISO-10646-UCS-4"?>

]DEL]
[INS[
   <?xml version='1.0' encoding="iso-10646-ucs-4"?>

]INS]
   In this example, the charset parameter has been omitted, and there is
   no BOM.  However, the XML [INS[MIME]] entity does have an encoding
   declaration inside the XML [INS[MIME]] entity that specifies the entity's
   charset.  Following the requirements in section 4.3.3 [INS[of [XML] ]], and
   optionally applying the mechanism described in Appendix F (non-
   normative) of [[DEL[REC-]]XML], the XML processor determines the charset of the
   XML [INS[MIME]] entity (in this example, UCS-4).

   An XML-unaware MIME processor [DEL[should]] [INS[SHOULD]] make no assumptions about the
   charset of the XML [INS[MIME]] entity.

[INS[
8.12 Text/xml-external-parsed-entity with UTF-8 Charset

   Content-type: text/xml-external-parsed-entity; charset="utf-8"

   <?xml encoding="utf-8"?>

   This is the recommended charset value for use with text/xml-
   external-parsed-entity.  Since the charset parameter is provided,
   MIME and XML processors MUST treat the enclosed entity as UTF-8
   encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g., SMTP), the XML MIME entity
   MUST use a content-transfer-encoding of either quoted-printable or
   base64.  For an 8-bit clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME ESMTP or NNTP),
   or a binary clean transport (e.g., HTTP) no content-transfer-encoding
   is necessary.

*9. IANA Considerations
>As described in Section 7, this document updates the [RFC2048]
registration process for XML-based MIME types.
]INS]

*[DEL[4]] [INS[10.]] Security Considerations
>XML, as a subset of SGML, has [INS[all of]] the same security considerations
as specified in [RFC[DEL[-]]1874][DEL[, and likely more, due to its expected ubiquitous deployment.]]

   To paraphrase section 3 of [DEL[[RFC-1874] ]] [INS[RFC 1874]], XML [INS[MIME]] entities contain
   information to be parsed and processed by the recipient's XML system.
   These entities may contain and such systems may permit explicit
   system level commands to be executed while processing the data.  To
   the extent that an XML system will execute arbitrary command strings,
   recipients of XML [INS[MIME]] entities may be a risk.  In general, it may be
   possible to specify commands that perform unauthorized file
   operations or make changes to the display processor's environment
   that affect subsequent operations.

[INS[
   In general, any information stored outside of the direct control of
   the user -- including CSS style sheets, XSL transformations, entity
   declarations, and DTDs -- can be a source of insecurity, by either
   obvious or subtle means.  For example, a tiny "whiteout attack"
   modification made to a "master" style sheet could make words in
   critical locations disappear in user documents, without directly
   modifying the user document or the stylesheet it references.  Thus,
   the security of any XML document is vitally dependent on all of the
   documents recursively referenced by that document.

   The entity lists and DTDs for XHTML 1.0[XHTML], for instance, are
   likely to be a commonly used set of information.  Many developers
   will use and trust them, few of whom will know much about the level
   of security on the W3C's servers, or on any similarly trusted
   repository.

   The simplest attack involves adding declarations that break
   validation.  Adding extraneous declarations to a list of character
   entities can effectively "break the contract" used by documents.  A
   tiny change that produces a fatal error in a DTD could halt XML
   processing on a large scale.  Extraneous declarations are fairly
   obvious, but more sophisticated tricks, like changing attributes from
   being optional to required, can be difficult to track down.  Perhaps
   the most dangerous option available to crackers is redefining default
   values for attributes: e.g., if developers have relied on defaulted
   attributes for security, a relatively small change might expose
   enormous quantities of information.

   Apart from the structural possibilities, another option, "entity
   spoofing," can be used to insert text into documents, vandalizing and
   perhaps conveying an unintended message.  Because XML 1.0 permits
   multiple entity declarations, and the first declaration takes
   precedence, it's possible to insert malicious content where an entity
   is used, such as by inserting the full text of Winnie the Pooh in
   every occurrence of &mdash;.

   Use of the digital signatures work currently underway by the xmldsig
   working group may eventually ameliorate the dangers of referencing
   external documents not under one's own control.

]INS]

   Use of XML is expected to be varied, and widespread.  XML is under
   scrutiny by a wide range of communities for use as a common syntax
   for community-specific metadata.  For example, the Dublin
   Core[INS[[RFC2413] ]] group is using XML for document metadata, and a new
   effort has begun [DEL[which]] [INS[that]] is considering use of XML for medical
   information.  Other groups view XML as a mechanism for marshalling
   parameters for remote procedure calls.  More uses of XML will
   undoubtedly arise.

   Security considerations will vary by domain of use.  For example, XML
   medical records will have much more stringent privacy and security
   considerations than XML library metadata.  Similarly, use of XML as a
   parameter marshalling syntax necessitates a case by case security
   review.

   XML may also have some of the same security concerns as plain text.
   Like plain text, XML can contain escape sequences [DEL[which]] [INS[that]], when
   displayed, have the potential to change the display processor
   environment in ways that adversely affect subsequent operations.
   Possible effects include, but are not limited to, locking the
   keyboard, changing display parameters so subsequent displayed text is
   unreadable, or even changing display parameters to deliberately
   obscure or distort subsequent displayed material so that its meaning
   is lost or altered.  Display processors [INS[should]] [DEL[SHOULD]] either filter such
   material from displayed text or else make sure to reset all important
   settings after a given display operation is complete.

   Some terminal devices have keys whose output, when pressed, can be
   changed by sending the display processor a character sequence.  If
   this is possible the display of a text object containing such
   character sequences could reprogram keys to perform some illicit or
   dangerous action when the key is subsequently pressed by the user.
   In some cases not only can keys be programmed, they can be triggered
   remotely, making it possible for a text display operation to directly
   perform some unwanted action.  As such, the ability to program keys
   [DEL[should]] [INS[SHOULD]] be blocked either by filtering or by disabling the ability to
   program keys entirely.

   Note that it is also possible to construct XML documents [DEL[which]] [INS[that]] make
   use of what XML terms "entity references" (using the XML meaning of
   the term "entity"[DEL[, which differs from the MIME definition of this term]] [INS[as described in Section 2]]), to construct repeated
   expansions of text.  Recursive expansions are prohibited by [[DEL[REC-]]XML] and
   XML processors are required to detect them.  However, even 
   non-recursive expansions may cause problems with the finite computing
   resources of computers, if they are performed many times.
