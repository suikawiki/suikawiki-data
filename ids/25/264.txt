> When this document speaks of '''['''Definition: Strong TLS algorithms''']''', then the following must hold:
> No version of the TLS protocol that suffers known security flaws has been negotiated. At the point of writing of this document, versions of SSL prior to SSLv3 '''['''SSLv3''']''' MUST NOT be considered strong.
> A cipher suite has been selected for which key and algorithm strengths correspond to industry practice. At the time of writing of this document, the "export" cipher suites explicitly forbidden in appendix A.5 of '''['''TLSv11''']''' MUST NOT be considered strong.
