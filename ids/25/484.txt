> A new JavaScript event type, webkitplaybacktargetavailabilitychanged, is fired on HTML media elements (video or audio) to signal when AirPlay availability changes. The event object’s availability property returns a DOMString value, either "available" or "not-available", which you can test to determine whether to display your custom AirPlay button. (Note that there is no direct property access to the media element’s availability state; it is accessible only as an event property on the WebKitPlaybackTargetAvailabilityEvent object.) When you register a listener for this event type, an initial event is automatically dispatched to inform you of the current availability state; subsequent events report whenever the state changes, so you can respond by showing or hiding your AirPlay button. To implement the required response when the button is clicked, the new HTMLMediaElement method webkitShowPlaybackTargetPicker() displays the host device’s native AirPlay route picker (currently an action sheet on iPhone or a popover on iPad).
> Note: Because monitoring AirPlay availability may drain battery power, you should avoid registering a listener for the webkitplaybacktargetavailabilitychanged event unless you have a specific need for it, and remove any registered listeners when they are not needed.
