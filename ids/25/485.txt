> The HTMLMediaElement property webkitCurrentPlaybackTargetIsWireless indicates whether the currently selected AirPlay target is wireless, so that you can adjust your AirPlay button’s visual style accordingly. Changes in the wireless state are signaled by an event of type webkitcurrentplaybacktargetiswireless, reported with a generic Event object having no special property to denote the new wireless state; your event listener can obtain this information from the media element’s webkitCurrentPlaybackTargetIsWireless property.
