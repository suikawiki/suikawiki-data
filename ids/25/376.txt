> A sharp variable is a syntax in object initializers that allows serialization of objects that have cyclic references or multiple references to the same object.
> Warning: Sharp variables was a non-standard syntax for creating or serializing cyclic data graphs that used to be supported only by Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JS engine. This feature has been removed in bug 566700, Firefox 12.
