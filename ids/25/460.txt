> JSON Graph is a convention for modeling graph information as a JSON object. Applications that use Falcor represent all their domain data as a single JSON Graph object.
> JSON Graph is valid JSON and can be parsed by any JSON parser. However JSON Graph introduces new primitive types to JSON to allow JSON to be used to represent graph information in a simple and consistent way. While it is possible to work with JSON Graph data directly, it is much more convenient to work with it indirectly using tools that understand JSON Graph types. One way to think about Falcor is as a set of protocols and tools for transferring, storing, and retrieving data from JSON Graph objects.
