> The Open API Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how REST APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format. SmartBear Software is donating the Swagger Specification directly to the OAI as the basis of this Open Specification.

> Starting with version 2.0 of the Swagger Specification, the OAI will be involving API consumers, developers, providers, and vendors alike to build the most useful, comprehensive specification possible.
> The goal of the OAI specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.

> THE SWAGGER SPECIFICATION
> At the heart of the above tools is the Swagger Specification. The specification creates the RESTful contract for your API, detailing all of its resources and operations in a human and machine readable format for easy development, discovery, and integration.
> The specification is the basis of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) and is developed in an open, transparent, and collaborative community to standardize the way RESTful interfaces are defined.
