> This directive specifies a comma-separated list of properties that apply to the content. The list is enclosed in double quotation marks.
> The "broadcast" property specifies that the content is broadcast or live (and thus may be suitable for splitting to multiple downstream clients). If the "broadcast" property is not specified, it implies that the content is on-demand (that is, not broadcast or live). The "playlist" property specifies that the content possibly consists of multiple entries from a server-side playlist.<10>
> The syntax of the directive is defined as follows.
>  stream-prop = ( "broadcast" / "playlist" )
>  StreamTypes = "x-wms-stream-type=" 
>                %x22 stream-prop *( "," stream-prop ) %x22
