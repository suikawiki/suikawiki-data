> User agents MUST make information about the identity of the Web site that a user interacts with available. This '''['''Definition: identity signal ''']''' SHOULD be part of primary user interface during usage modes which entail the presence of signaling to the user beyond only presenting page content. Otherwise, it MUST be available through secondary user interface.
