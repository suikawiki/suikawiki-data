> App developers face a choice when a user taps a URL to either launch a browser, or build their own in-app browser using WebViews.
> Both options present challenges — launching the browser is a heavy context switch that isn't customizable, while WebViews don't share state with the browser and add maintenance overhead.
> Chrome custom tabs give apps more control over their web experience, and make transitions between native and web content more seamless without having to resort to a WebView.
> Chrome custom tabs allow an app to customize how Chrome looks and feels. An app can change things like:
> Toolbar color
> Enter and exit animations
> Add custom actions to the Chrome toolbar and overflow menu
> Chrome custom tabs also allow the developer to pre-start Chrome and pre-fetch content for faster loading.
