> '''['''Definition: An HTTP transaction is weakly TLS-protected if it is TLS-protected, but strong TLS protection could not be achieved for one of the following reasons:''']'''
> TLS handshake used an anonymous key exchange algorithm such as DH_anon
> the cryptographic algorithms negotiated are not considered strong
> certificates were used that are not either validated certificates, or self-signed certificates pinned to the destination (see 5.1.4 Self-signed Certificates and Untrusted Root Certificates)
> Weakly TLS-protected interactions may provide security services such as confidentiality protection against passive attackers, or integrity protection against active attackers (without confidentiality protection). These properties are often desirable, even if strong TLS protection cannot be achieved.
