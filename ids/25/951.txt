> Supporting homescreen-installed apps prior to M39
> Since M31, Chrome will look for the following meta tag in the <head> element of the web-page (if there's a manifest with display specified, this is ignored):
> <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
> The name attribute MUST be "mobile-web-app-capable" and the content attribute must be "yes" (case in-sensitive). If there is any other value in the content attribute the web app will be added as a regular bookmark.
