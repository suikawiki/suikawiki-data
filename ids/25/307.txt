> Opera has added a whitelist of top-level domains that aretrusted to enforce a safe policy on domain names. Severaltop-level registrars have strict rules for domain names.Opera for Windows, Mac and UNIX will check for an updatedlist of trusted TLDs on a regular basis. Opera now only accepts Latin 1 characters in domain namesfrom top-level domains that are not on the whitelist. Thiscovers Western European languages without introducing anyconvincing homographs.
>  
> Top-level domain registrars who have enforced strict domainname policies are encouraged to contact Opera Softwareto be included in the browser's whitelist, provided thattheir policies are approved.
