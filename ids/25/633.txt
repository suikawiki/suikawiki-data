> Siren is a hypermedia specification for representing entities. As HTML is used for visually representing documents on a Web site, Siren is a specification for presenting entities via a Web API. Siren offers structures to communicate information about entities, actions for executing state transitions, and links for client navigation.
> Siren is intended to be a general specification of a generic media type that can be applied to other types that are not inherently hypermedia-powered. The initial implementation is JSON Siren. Other implementations, such as XML Siren, may also be implemented using the Siren specification.
