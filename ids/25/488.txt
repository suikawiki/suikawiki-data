> Text styles, introduced in iOS 7, are semantic descriptions of the intended uses for fonts and are implemented by a mechanism known as Dynamic Type. Text styles are organized by use and represented by constants defined in UIFontDescriptor.h, as shown in Table 9-1. The actual font used for the purpose described by a text style can vary based on a number of dynamic considerations, including the user’s content size category preference, which is represented by the UIApplication property preferredContentSizeCategory. To acquire a font object for a given text style, you pass the corresponding constant to the UIFont method preferredFontForTextStyle:. To acquire a font descriptor for a text style, pass the constant to the UIFontDescriptor method preferredFontDescriptorWithTextStyle:.

> The Dynamic Type mechanism, introduced in iOS 7, allows applications to choose fonts for text display based on their intended semantic use (such as for body text, headlines, or captions). WebKit has added a series of new properties to support the use of Dynamic Type in your web pages:
> -apple-system-body
> -apple-system-headline
> -apple-system-subheadline
> -apple-system-caption1
> -apple-system-caption2
> -apple-system-footnote
> -apple-system-short-body
> -apple-system-short-headline
> -apple-system-short-subheadline
> -apple-system-short-caption1
> -apple-system-short-footnote
> -apple-system-tall-body
