>XML Processing Description Language (XPDL) simplifies the management of document sets and makes document processing more reliable. By creating descriptions for classes of documents, rather than relying on documents to link to processing descriptions themselves, XPDL makes it possible to move beyond the monolithic model presented by DTDs today and to add new resources, like schemas, style sheets, and processing information to the concept of a document class.
