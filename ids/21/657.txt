> Scheme name:  filesystem
> Status:  Historical
> Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:
>   This scheme was part of the "File API: Directories and System"
>   W3C Working Draft.  It was intended to be implemented by web user
>   agents such as web browsers.  The specification did not gain traction
>   and was abandoned.  At the time of writing this registration, the
>   specification is only known to be implemented in the Google Chrome
>   family of web browsers, under a "webkit" vendor prefix.
