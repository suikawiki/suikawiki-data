[B[Universal Container Format (UCF)]]
>A general-purpose container technology that collects a related set of files into a single-file container. UCF is based on the widely used ZIP archival format, and conforms to the OEBPS Container Format guidelines, as well as the Open Document Format 1.0 specification. Off-the-shelf ZIP tools can be used to open, inspect, and extract files from UCF packages.
