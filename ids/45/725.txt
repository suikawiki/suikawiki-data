> All builtin commands other than ‘[CODE[echo]]’ and precommand modifiers, even those that have no options, can be given the argument ‘[CODE[--]]’ to terminate option processing. This indicates that the following words are non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored. This is useful in cases where arguments to the command may begin with ‘[CODE[-]]’. For historical reasons, most builtin commands (including ‘[CODE[echo]]’) also recognize a single ‘[CODE[-]]’ in a separate word for this purpose; note that this is less standard and use of ‘[CODE[--]]’ is recommended.
