> The <?pike ... ?> processing instruction tag (PI for short) is used to smoothly inline pike code in your pages. The perhaps most usable aspect of this is for quickly throwing together a small webpage application or for experimenting and toying around with the roxen programming environment. Since the code resides in the page, it won't be so reusable a component, as would a roxen module, but the short cycle time between applying a change and seeing the results right after another page reload make it an ideal development tool.
