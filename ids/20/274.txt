> >I agree with Benoit and I think there is a reason Object.prototype.watch is still in Firefox and won't go away any time soon
> As far as I know the only reason it's there and hasn't been removed is because it's used to implement debugger watchpoints '''['''1''']'''. And the only reason it's web-exposed is because SpiderMonkey has not prioritized being able to expose APIs to privileged code but not the web (something that think should get fixed).
