> Video is a great way for sites to reach their users, but it can be jarring when it plays unexpectedly. This is especially true on mobile, where the user may be in an environment where audio is unwanted. Chrome on Android now allows muted videos to begin playing without user interaction. If the video was marked as muted and has the autoplay attribute, Chrome will start playing the video when it becomes visible to the user. Developers can also use script to play muted videos without user interaction. Muted videos that begin playing sound before a user action will automatically be paused.
