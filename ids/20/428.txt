> The 7 September, 2010 version of the specification drops support for the openURL method, which was part of previous versions of this specification. The Working Group found a number of privacy and security issues relating to openURL, as well as a way to achieve the same intended functionality via other means, and hence decided to drop it from the specification.
> The working group recommends that authors use HTML's a element to achieve the same functionality, or use the window.open() method where appropriate.
