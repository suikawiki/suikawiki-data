> To achieve this, WebKit in iOS 11 includes a new CSS function, constant(), and a set of four pre-defined constants, safe-area-inset-left, safe-area-inset-right, safe-area-inset-top, and safe-area-inset-bottom. When combined, these allow style declarations to reference the current size of the safe area insets on each side.
> The CSS Working Group recently resolved to add this feature, but with a different name. Please keep this in mind while adopting.
