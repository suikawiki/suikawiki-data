>  LDC messages have been defined that communicate time-of-day,
> leap second information, differential corrections and LORAN-C network health and status information to
> users [8]. Time-of-day is calculated by propagating a count of LORAN message repetition intervals (MRI)
> that have occurred since the LORAN-C epoch (January 1, 1958) and applying the leap second information.
> The MRI count and the leap second information are provided in the time message via the LDC.
