<http://www.au.kddi.com/ezfactory/tec/spec/wap_tag7.html> - according
to this page, localsrc value is either "icon number" or "symbol name".
The latest emoji list page
<http://www.au.kddi.com/ezfactory/tec/spec/3.html> contains list of
"icon numbers", but does not contain "symbol names".  "Symbol names"
are included in older versions of the list - see
