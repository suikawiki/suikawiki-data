> Regardless of the authentication mechanism that was used during an HTTP request, the server must always return a User header, which contains a URI representing the user's identity. For example, the User header may contain either an HTTP URI (i.e. the WebID of the user that was just authenticated), or a different URI (mailto:, dns:, tel:, etc.).
> The User header can also be used to verify that a user has successfully authenticated (specifically, that the HTTP URI that the header contains points to a valid WebID profile), as well as to bootstrap the way apps personalize the user experience, since apps have an easy way of discovering the user's identity.
