> For many purposes it is convenient to make temporal calculations in terms of clock durations that exceed everyday units such as days, weeks, months and years, using a representation of temporal position in a temporal coordinate system '''['''iso19108''']''', i.e. on a number line with a specified origin, such as Julian date, or Unix time.
