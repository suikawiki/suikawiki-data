> When the client requests an image, the server may add a link header to the response that indicates the canonical URI for that request:
> Link: <http://iiif.example.com/server/full/400,/0/default.jpg>;rel="canonical"
> The server may include this link header on the image information response, however it is unnecessary as it is included in the JSON representation retrieved.
