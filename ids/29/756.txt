> Physical concatenation protocol.
> Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were a unique resource.
> A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
> concat:URL1|URL2|...|URLN
> where URL1, URL2, ..., URLN are the urls of the resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct protocol.
> For example to read a sequence of files split1.mpeg, split2.mpeg, split3.mpeg with ffplay use the command:
> ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg
> Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for many shells.
