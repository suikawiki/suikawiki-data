> Support for headers in links:
> a(headers='Accept:application/vnd.jiron+jade') Some Jiron resource
> Which would translate to this, if HTML knew how to deal with it:
> <a headers="Accept:application/vnd.jiron+jade">Some Jiron resource</a>
> The Jiron client will attach a link activation handler that will set the appropriate accept header and fetch the resource using AJAX.
