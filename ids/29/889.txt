> JSON-WSP (JavaScript Object Notation Web-Service Protocol) was a web-service protocol informal proposal that uses JSON for service description, requests and responses. It is very much inspired from JSON-RPC and WSDL. It is waiting for JSON#JSON Schema.
> A JSON-WSP standard never existed, even as RFC experiment or draft-proposal.
