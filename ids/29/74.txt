> As noted in Chapter 2, the classic implementation of Markdown is beautifully simple but is not adequate for serious typesetting. Softcover therefore supports a superset of vanilla Markdown called Softcovered-flavored Markdown (SFM), which includes select kramdown extensions (Section 3.1), advanced enhancements such as GitHub-style fenced code blocks (Section 3.2), and super-advanced additions via embedded LATEX (Section 3.3). As noted in Chapter 2, the Softcover dialect of Markdown is, to our knowledge, the most powerful one available.
