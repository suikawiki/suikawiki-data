> ThoughÂ we understand many peopleÂ would love to use Markdown in Slack messages, we have no plans to support it. Our message formatting is similar to other popular services like Skype and Google Talk, and isÂ intended for a majority of our users who are unfamiliar with Markdown. However, we'll keep it in mind for the future.Â ðŸ”®
