> Strictdown is a Markdown-like markup language originally for writing simple HTML documents which can be printed out onto a paper.
> It aims to provide a better syntax for plain text writing with nice editors, and for writing correct parsers (...vanilla Markdown sucks ;-).
> It focus on readability, simplicity and consistency, and has a stricter syntax but some extra features which the vanilla Markdown doesn't provide. So, its syntax is different from vanilla Markdown's in many ways.
> It is not only for phonograms (like English), but for logograms (like Chinese). And I'm a Chinese. I think lots of Chinese people will find it more suitable for their works.
