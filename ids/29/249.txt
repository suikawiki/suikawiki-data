> DDP is a protocol between a client and a server that supports two operations:
> Remote procedure calls by the client to the server.
> The client subscribing to a set of documents, and the server keeping the client informed about the contents of those documents as they change over time.
> This document specifies the version "1" of DDP. It's a rough description of the protocol and not intended to be entirely definitive.
