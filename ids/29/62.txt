> This is a description of the rel="archived" attribute value for HTMLÂ 5. The purpose of this value is to indicate that the target resource is archived and kept largely or solely for historical purposes. It is most likely no longer updated and therefore may not comply with modern standards and specifications, either of the organisation publishing it, or of the wider web. Testing tools may wish to disregard the target resource.
