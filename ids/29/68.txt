> The kramdown syntax is based on the Markdown syntax and has been enhanced with features that are found in other Markdown implementations like Maruku, PHP Markdown Extra and Pandoc. However, it strives to provide a strict syntax with definite rules and therefore isn’t completely compatible with Markdown. Nonetheless, most Markdown documents should work fine when parsed with kramdown.

>  This demonstrated some, but not all features of kramdown-rfc2629. Since markdown/kramdown does not cater for all the structure of an RFC 7749 style document, some of the markup is in XML, and the example switches between XML and markdown using kramdown's {::nomarkdown} and {:/nomarkdown} (this is ugly, but works well enough).
