> Make your API self documenting and your clients adaptable to API changes. It's all in the hypermedia type.
> Jiron is a hypermedia type based on Siren and the Jade template language. Instead of delivering your data in JSON messages, pack that data with related links, actions that clients can request on the reperesented resource, even code on demand to upgrade the client's capabilities to deal with the given resource.
