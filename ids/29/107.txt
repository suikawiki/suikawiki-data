[10] [DFN[leap smear]] は、[[閏秒]]の実施時に、周囲の各[[秒]]の長さを調整することで見かけの[[閏秒]]をなくすものです。
比較的正確に[[時刻同期]]されたシステムと[[閏秒のない時刻系]]の両立手法として広く用いられています。

> No commonly used operating system is able to handle a minute with 61 seconds, and trying to special-case the leap second has caused many problems in the past. Instead of adding a single extra second to the end of the day, we'll run the clocks 0.0014% slower across the ten hours before and ten hours after the leap second, and “smear” the extra second across these twenty hours. For timekeeping purposes, December 31 will seem like any other day.
> All Google services, including all APIs, will be synchronized on smeared time, as described above. You’ll also get smeared time for virtual machines on Compute Engine if you follow our recommended settings. You can use non-Google NTP servers if you don’t want your instances to use the leap smear, but don’t mix smearing and non-smearing time servers.

> Since 2008, instead of applying leap seconds to our servers using clock steps, we have "smeared" the extra second across the hours before and after each leap. The leap smear applies to all Google services, including all our APIs.

> Several other smears have been proposed or implemented.
> UTC-SLS is a linear smear over 1,000 s before the leap (23:43:20 to 00:00:00).
> Google's 2008 smear was a 20-hour cosine smear before the leap (04:00:00 to 00:00:00). We used a cosine smear only for leap #34.
> Bloomberg's smear is a linear smear over 2,000 s after the leap (00:00:00 to 00:33:20).
> Amazon, Microsoft, and Akamai have implemented 24-hour smears.

> The solution we came up with came to be known as the “leap smear.” We modified our internal NTP servers to gradually add a couple of milliseconds to every update, varying over a time window before the moment when the leap second actually happens.
