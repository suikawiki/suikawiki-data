* XML Base [CODE(XMLa)@en[xml:base=""]] attributes

** xmlbase/

[78] [[Firefox]] 3.0.4 and [[Opera]] 9.61: '''[[HTML5]] [[URL]]'''.  The document encoding
is used rather than UTF-8.

[79] [[Safari]] 3.2.1:  Unknown.  It resolves the empty string as 
the URL of the document (as per RFC 2396), not the base URL, such that this test cases cannot be used
to determine how it interpret non-ASCII characters in URLs.

* XLink simple links

** xlink/

[80] [[Firefox]] 3.0.4 and [[Safari]] 3.2.1: '''[[HTML5]] [[URL]]'''.  The document encoding
is used rather than UTF-8.

[81] [[Opera]] 9.61: '''IRI'''.   UTF-8 is always used.

* [CODE(XML)@en[<?xml-stylesheet?>]] processing instructions

** xml-stylesheet/css-1

[82] [[Firefox]] 3.0.4, [[Opera]] 9.61, and [[Safari]] 3.2.1: '''[[HTML5]] [[URL]]'''.  The document encoding
is used rather than UTF-8.

* Atom 1.0 feeds

** feeds/atom10-feed-link-alternate-1

[2] <feed><link rel=alternate href=?non-ascii>

[3] [[Firefox]] 3.0.4: '''IRI'''.  When subscribed, the UTF-8-percent-encoded href URL is used
as the site URL of the bookmark entry.

[4] [[Safari]] 3.2.1: '''IRI'''.  When the feed is rendered as the Safari-generated HTML document,
the UTF-8-percent-encoded href URL is used in a href="" attributes.

[5] [[Opera]] 9.61: Unknown.  (Unused?)

[6] [[WinIE]] 7: '''IRI'''.  When the feed is rendered as the WinIE-generated HTML document,
non-percent-encoded href URL is used as the link destination.

;; It does not percent-encode the URL before it is used as [[HTTP]] [[Request-URI]].

;; It does not support [[HTTP]] [CODE(MIME)@en[[[charset]]]] parameter.

[7] [[Google Reader]] (Tested: 2008-12): Unknown.  (Unused?)

[8] [[livedoor Reader]] (Tested: 2008-12): '''IRI'''.  The UTF-8-percent-encoded href URL is used.

;; It does not support relative references in href="".

[9] [[Hatena RSS]] (Tested: 2008-12): Unknown.  (Unused?)

[10] [[Thunderbird]] 2.0.0.18: Unknown.  (Unused?)

** feeds/atom10-entry-link-alternate-1

[11] <feed><entry><link rel=alternate href=?non-ascii>

[12]  [[Firefox]] 3.0.4: '''IRI, with quirks'''.  

When the feed is rendered as the Firefox-generated HTML document, the percent-encoded
href="" URL is used in the a href="" attribute for an entry.  It is encoded in UTF-8
in general.  However, if the page from which the feed is linked is encoded in non-UTF-8
encoding, then it is encoded in that encoding (!).

Once the feed is subscribed as "live bookmark", the menu items (= feed entries)
are always associated with the UTF-8 version of the URL.

[13] [[Safari]] 3.2.1: '''IRI'''.  When the feed is rendered as the Safari-generated HTML document,
the UTF-8-percent-encoded href URL is used in a href="" attributes.

[14] [[Opera]] 9.61: '''IRI'''.  When subscribed, the entry is linked to the UTF-8-percent-encoded
URL.

[15] [[WinIE]] 7: '''IRI'''.  When the feed is rendered as the WinIE-generated HTML document,
non-percent-encoded href URL is used as the link destination.

;; It does not percent-encode the URL before it is used as [[HTTP]] [[Request-URI]], again.

[16] [[Google Reader]] (Tested: 2008-12): '''IRI'''.  It does not percent-encode
href URLs even when it is used in HTML a href="" attribute.  Since Google Reader geenrates
UTF-8 HTML pages, it is interpreted as an IRI reference.

[17] [[livedoor Reader]] (Tested: 2008-12): '''IRI'''.  The UTF-8-percent-encoded href URL is used.

;; It does not support relative references in href="".

;; It does not show entries which does not contain <atom:content/> (and <atom:description/> and so on).

[18] [[Hatena RSS]] (Tested: 2008-12): '''IRI'''.  It does not percent-encode
href URLs even when it is used in HTML a href="" attribute.  Since Hatena RSS geenrates
UTF-8 HTML pages, it is interpreted as an IRI reference.

;; It does not support ISO-2022-JP.

;; It does not support relative references in href="".

[19] [[Thunderbird]] 2.0.0.18: '''IRI'''.  The UTF-8-percent-encoded href URL is used.
