Hello! Given that the subject of this wiki page is an old project of mine from 1997, I must admit my curiousity about why it is showing up here on this wiki. The SHML proposal became the starter document for the W3C's Recommendation [<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization> Modularization of XHTML]. I must admit, I'll have to look up where .cx is even located! -- [[Murray Altheim]]

that World Wide Web technologies such as [[HTML]],
[[XML]], [[HTTP]], [[URI]] and so on,
including their history.
That is why this wiki page is.

[CODE[[[cx]]]] stands for Christmas Island
(Austoralian).  Some domain in [CODE[.cx]] ccTLD,
such as suika.fam.cx, is used by Japanese people.
