> Property
> A feature of a Resource, that often has a particular data type. In the model sections, the term "Property" is used to refer to only those features which are not Relationships and instead have a literal value such as a string, integer or date. The valid values for a Property are thus any data type other than object, or an array containing members of that data type if more than one is allowed.
