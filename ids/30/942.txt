>      "A" indicates one hour earlier, and "M" indicates 12  hours  ear-
>      lier;  "N"  is  one  hour  later, and "Y" is 12 hours later.  The
>      letter "J" is not used.  The other remaining two forms are  taken
>      from ANSI standard X3.51-1975.  One allows explicit indication of

>      strings for indicating time zones in North America.
