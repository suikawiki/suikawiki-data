> The response from the Annotation Server must have a Link header entry where the target IRI is http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource and the rel parameter value is type. The Annotation type of http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#Annotation may also be added with the same rel type. This is to let client systems know that the retrieved representation is a Resource and an Annotation, even if the client cannot process the representation's format.
