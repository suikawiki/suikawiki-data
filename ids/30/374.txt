> In this paper, we study the precise complexity of XPath
> 1.0 query processing. Even though heavily used by its incorporation
> into a variety of XML-related standards, the
> precise cost of evaluating an XPath query is not yet wellunderstood.
> The first polynomial-time algorithm for XPath
> processing (with respect to combined complexity) was proposed
> only recently, and even to this day all major XPath
> engines take time exponential in the size of the input queries.
> From the standpoint of theory, the precise complexity of
> XPath query evaluation is open, and it is thus unknown
> whether the query evaluation problem can be parallelized.
> In this work, we show that both the data complexity and
> the query complexity of XPath 1.0 fall into lower (highly parallelizable)
> complexity classes, but that the combined complexity
> is PTIME-hard. Subsequently, we study the sources
> of this hardness and identify a large and practically important
> fragment of XPath 1.0 for which the combined complexity
> is LOGCFL-complete and, therefore, in the highly
> parallelizable complexity class NC2.
