> Throughout this document, the term "local file" is used to describe
>    files that can be accessed through the local file system API using
>    only the information included in the file path, not relying on other
>    information (such as network addresses).  It is important to note
>    that a local file may not be physically located on the local machine,
>    for example, if a networked file system is transparently mounted into
>    the local file system.
