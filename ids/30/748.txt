> The WebDAV Brief header is used to reduce the verbosity of DAV responses by omitting portions of the response that may be implied by the absence of a response.
> The Brief header may be used in the PROPFIND Method, the BPROPFIND Method, the PROPPATCH Method, and the BPROPPATCH Method. Using it in any other method will have no effect. To use this functionality, set the Brief header to "t ". The default setting is "f ".
> Brief := "Brief" ":" ( "t" | "f" )
