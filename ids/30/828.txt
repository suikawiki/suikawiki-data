> Although the '''['''SSML''']''' specification makes reference to a registry of alphabets, one has not been published. As the charter of the W3C Voice Browser Working Group has expired, the publication of such a registry is not anticipated. Authors therefore need to reference Reading System support documentation to determine what alphabet values are supported. Some common alphabets include: x-JEITA (also x-JEITA-IT-4002 and x-JEITA-IT-4006) and x-sampa.
