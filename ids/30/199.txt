> This relationship is intended to be used both within Linked Data descriptions and as the rel type of a Link, via HTTP Link Headers '''['''rfc5988''']''' for binary resources and in HTML <link> elements. For more information about these, please see the Annotation Protocol specification '''['''annotation-protocol''']'''.
