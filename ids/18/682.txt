> The LDP WG is now closed. As of 28 July 2015, the WG has finished wrapping things up by publishing the remaining specs as Working Group Notes. Having produced the LDP 1.0 Recommendation and explored the possibility of chartering a new WG (see Linked Data 2015 report and public mailing list), the WG decided to pursue discussions on LDP Next in a Community Group. If you're interested in working on LDP, please, join the LDP Next CG!
