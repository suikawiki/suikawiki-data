> OpenPayee must either provide a standardised use case for the payment rel type or register a new one. To avoid ambiguity with any systems that currently use the “payment” type it is recommended that a new type is registered for the specific purpose of identifying OpenPayee Providers.

> You include Flattr in your feeds and HTML by adding payment links, using the standard payment relation, to your feed, feed entries or HTML-head that you point directly to (without any redirects) the auto-submit URL:s for that content.
> Example
> In an Atom feed add something like this to an entry:
> <link rel="payment" href="https://flattr.com/submit/auto?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.flattr.net%2F&amp;user_id=flattr" type="text/html" />
> In an item in a RSS feed add this instead:
> <atom:link rel="payment" href="https://flattr.com/submit/auto?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.flattr.net%2F&amp;user_id=flattr" type="text/html" />
> And in a RSS feed also make sure that the RSS-container itself knows of the atom:link-tag by adding the atom-namespace:
> <rss xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
> In HTML add something like this to the head-tag of the document:
> <link rel="payment" href="https://flattr.com/submit/auto?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.flattr.net%2F&amp;user_id=flattr" type="text/html" />
