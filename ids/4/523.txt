* Strings

[15] 
For the purpose of this specification,
a [DFN[character]]
is anything that is considered as one of "characters",
including but not limited to:
letters,
digits,
symbols,
[[bytes][byte]],
[[code points][code point]],
[[grapheme clusters][grapheme cluster]],
glyphs,
and as such.

[19] 
A
[DFN[character escape]]
is a
[[string]] whose first [[character]] is a
[CODE[U+003A]] [CODE(charname)@en[COLON]] character ([CODE[:]]).
It represents a [[character]] identified
by applying the application-specific mapping rule to the [[string]].

[EG[
[23] 
An application might define that [[character escape]]
":nga"
represents a sequence of two 
[[code points][code point]]
[CODE[<[[U+304B]] [[U+309A]]>]]
[CODE(charname)@en[HIRAGANA LETTER KA WITH SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK]]
and
[[character escape]]
":wikipedia"
represents the [[favicon]] of [CITE[Wikipedia]].

]EG]

-*-*-

[17] 
A [DFN[character sequence]] 
is a sequence of zero or more [[characters][character]].
[[Character sequence][character sequence]]
can be represented in two ways:
[[simple character sequence]] 
and
[[list character sequence]].

[18] 
A [DFN[simple character sequence]]
is a [[string]]
of 
zero or more
[[scalar values][scalar value]]
whose first [[character]], if any, is not a
[CODE[U+003A]] [CODE(charname)@en[COLON]] character ([CODE[:]])
or a
[CODE[U+002E]] [CODE(charname)@en[FULL STOP]] character ([CODE[.][FULL STOP]]).
It represents the sequence of the [[scalar values][scalar value]]
in the [[string]], in order.
It cannot be used to represent a [[character sequence]]
which contains a [[character]] that is not a [[scalar value]]
or starts with a 
[CODE[U+003A]] [CODE(charname)@en[COLON]] character ([CODE[:]]) 
or a
[CODE[U+002E]] [CODE(charname)@en[FULL STOP]] character ([CODE[.][FULL STOP]]).

[20] 
A [DFN[list character sequence]]
is a [[list]] of
zero or more of
[[simple character sequences][simple character sequence]]
and
[[character escapes][character escape]].
It represents the sequence of the [[characters][character]]
represented by the [[items]] of the [[list]], in order.

[EG[
[21] 
In the aforementioned application (>>23),
a [[list]]:

« "ふじわら", "の", "み", "ちな", ":nga" »

.. represents a [[character sequence]] of ten (10) characters:
"ふじわらのみちな" followed by [CODE[<[[U+304B]] [[U+309A]]>]].

]EG]

;;
[22] 
Item boundaries in a [[list character sequence]] has no semantics.

* Segmented texts

[29] 
A text might consist of one or more parts, separated by implicit or
explicit boundaries.  It can be described as [[segmented texts][segmented text]].

[24] 
A [DFN[segmented text]]
is a [[list]]
of zero or more of
[[character sequences][character sequence]]
and
[[segment separators][segment separator]].

[25] 
The [VAR[n]]th [[character sequence]] in a [[segmented text]] is referred to as
the [VAR[n]]th [DFN[segment]] of the [[segmented text]].
A [[segment]] represents an [[ordered set]] of [[strings][string]],
identified by applying the [[segment mapping rule]] to the [[character sequence]].

[28] 
A [DFN[segment separator]] is a [[string]] whose first character is a 
[CODE[U+002E]] [CODE(charname)@en[FULL STOP]] character ([CODE[.][FULL STOP]]).
It represents an [[ordered set]] of [[strings][string]],
identified by applying the [[segment separator mapping rule]] to the [[string]].
They describe orthographical or stylistic options.

[32] 
Any usage of [[segmented text]] is associated with two mapping rules:
[DFN[segment mapping rule]] (from [[segment]] to an [[ordered set]] of [[strings][string]]), and
[DFN[segment separator mapping rule]] (from [[segment separator]] to an [[ordered set]] of [[strings][string]]).
The [[strings][string]] obtained by these rules are referred to as
[DFN[text representations][text representation]] of its input.

[33] 
Unless otherwise specified, the [[segment mapping rule]]
returns an [[ordered set]] that only contains the input as is.

[34] 
The [[segment separator mapping rule]] for input [VAR[input]] is as follows:

[FIG(steps)[
= [35] 
If [[allowed segment separators]] [ [VAR[input]] ] [[exists]],
== [36] 
Return [[allowed segment separators]] [ [VAR[input]] ].
= [37] Otherwise, return failure.
]FIG]

[38] 
Any usage of [[segmented text]] is associated with an [[ordered map]]:
[DFN[allowed segment separators]].  
Unless otherwise specified, it [[is empty]].



[27] 
A [[segmented text]] as a whole represents a set of texts which
can be obtained by concatenating the [[segments][segment]] and
the text representations of the [[segment separators][segment separator]]
in the [[segmented text]], in order.
As a [[segment]] or [[segment separator]] can have multiple 
[[text representations][text representation]],
a [[segment text]] represents a set of the texts with every
possible combinations of them.  Any item of the set
is referred to as the [[text representations][text representation]].

[EG[
[14] A [[segmented text]]:

« "チンギス", "..", "ハーン" »

... is a [[string]] "チンギス" followed by a [[segment separator]] 
[CODE[..]]
followed by a [[string]] "ハーン".  
The [[allowed segment separator]] could be
an [[ordered map]]:

«[ [CODE[..]] → « "" (the empty string), "・", "=" » ]»

..., i.e. [[segment separator]] [CODE[..]] represents
different conventions of Japanese foreign word
boundary indicators.
In this case the [[segmented text]] represents:
"チンギスハーン",
"チンギス・ハーン", and
"チンギス=ハーン".

]EG]

[26] 
The [DFN[segment length]] of the [[segmented text]] is the number of the
[[character sequences][character sequence]] in the [[segmented text]].

** Alphabetical segmented text

[30] 
An [DFN[alphabetical segmented text]] is a [[segmented text]]
used to describe alphabetical words.
For the purpose of this specification, the term "alphabetical" 
includes Latin, Greek, and similar scripts.



[39] 
The [[segment mapping rule]] of an [[alphabetical segmented text]]
returns an [[ordered set]]
that consists of all the possible [[strings][string]] that are
[[caselessly equal]] to the input.
That is,
any alphabetical [[character]] 
in [[segments][segment]] of an [[alphabetical segmented text]]
represents lowercase and uppercase variants of
the letter.

[40] 
Unless otherwise specified,
a [[string]] is 
[DFN[caselessly equal]]
to another [[string]]
in the context of an [[alphabetical segmented text]]
if they are equivalent in [[default caseless matching]].

@@
[41] Ligatures and styled letters

[43] 
Use of cases in a [[segment]] of an [[alphabetical segmented text]] 
represents the most popular casing of the word.
If case is not important for the word, it should be represented 
in lowercase letters.
If the word is typically capitalized (e.g. proper noun in English), 
it should be represented
in lowercase letters except for the first uppercase letter.
If the word has irregular casing convention, it should be represented with it.


[42] 
The [[allowed segment separators]] for [[alphabetical segmented text]]
contain the following [[entries][entry]]:

- [51] 
[CODE[.-]] → « [CODE[-]], [CODE(charname)@en[HYPHEN]], [CODE(charname)@en[SPACE]] », which represents
hyphens between words.

[CODE[._]] → « [CODE(charname)@en[SPACE]] », which represents spaces
between words.

casing convention.  The [[segments][segment]] "Donald", "E", and "Knuth"
are normally capitalized.  The [[segment]] "TeX" has irregular
mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters.
[[Segments][segment]] are separated by spaces and the [[segment]]
"E" is followed by a period.

A [[label]] can have an [[entry]] « "abbr", [VAR[abbr type]] »,
where [VAR[abbr type]] is referred to as the [[label]]'s [DFN[[F[abbreviation type]]]].
If the [[label]] has no such [[entry]], the [[label]]'s [F[abbreviation type]]
is [CODE[null]].

[114] 
A [[label]]'s [F[abbreviation type]] is either:
[CODE[null]],
"[CODE[single]]",
or
"[CODE[acronym]]".
The value [CODE[single]] represents that the 
[[label]] is a single-character abbreviation.
The value [CODE[acronym]] represents that the
[[label]] is an acronym.
The value [CODE[null]] represents that the 
[[label]] is not classified as an abbreviation.


* Label sets

[110] 
A [DFN[label set]] represents a set of [[labels][label]].

[111] 
A [[label set]] is an [[ordered map]].

[112] 
A [[label set]] has an [[entry]] « "labels", [VAR[list]] »,
where [VAR[list]] is a [[list]] of one or more [[labels][label]].
For a [[label set]] [VAR[ls]],
the [[labels][label]] in [VAR[ls]] [ [CODE[labels]] ]
are the [[labels][label]] represented by [VAR[ls]].
Whether the order of the [[labels][label]] is significant or not
is application-dependent.

and
[[parse a JSON string to an Infra value]]
are defined by the [CITE[Infra Standard]].
An [DFN[empty list]]
is a [[list]] that [[is empty]].

[16] 
The terms
[[grapheme cluster]]
and
[[default caseless matching]]
are defined by [CITE[The Unicode Standard]].

[10] 
The terms 
[[array]],
and
[[object]]
are defined by the JSON specification [SRC[[[ECMA-404]]]].

[12] 
In this specification,
requirements on the JSON string data is phrased as requirements
on the Infra values, which are obtained by applying the
[[parse a JSON string to an Infra value]]
steps to the JSON string.
