* Appendix A. Why Use the '+xml' Suffix for XML-Based MIME Types?

[INS[

[PRE[
   Although the use of a suffix was not considered as part of the
   original MIME architecture, this choice is considered to provide the
   most functionality with the least potential for interoperability
   problems or lack of future extensibility.  The alternatives to the
   '+xml' suffix and the reason for its selection are described below.
]PRE]

A.1 Why not just use text/xml or application/xml and let the XML
[PRE[
    processor dispatch to the correct application based on the
    referenced DTD?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   text/xml and application/xml remain useful in many situations,
   especially for document-oriented applications that involve combining
   XML with a stylesheet in order to present the data.  However, XML is
   also used to define entirely new data types, and an XML-based format
   such as image/svg+xml fits the definition of a MIME media type
   exactly as well as image/png[PNG] does.  (Note that image/svg+xml is
   not yet registered.) Although extra functionality is available for
   MIME processors that are also XML processors, XML-based media types
   -- even when treated as opaque, non-XML media types -- are just as
   useful as any other media type and should be treated as such.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Since MIME dispatchers work off of the MIME type, use of text/xml or
   application/xml to label discrete media types will hinder correct
   dispatching and general interoperability.  Finally, many XML
   documents use neither DTDs nor namespaces, yet are perfectly legal
   XML.
]PRE]

A.2 Why not create a new subtree (e.g., image/xml.svg) to represent XML
[PRE[
    MIME types?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The subtree under which a media type is registered -- IETF, vendor
   (*/vnd.*), or personal (*/prs.*); see [RFC2048] for details -- is
   completely orthogonal from whether the media type uses XML syntax or
   not.  The suffix approach allows XML document types to be identified
   within any subtree.  The vendor subtree, for example, is likely to
   include a large number of XML-based document types.  By using a
   suffix, rather than setting up a separate subtree, those types may
   remain in the same location in the tree of MIME types that they would
   have occupied had they not been based on XML.
]PRE]

A.3 Why not create a new top-level MIME type for XML-based media types?

[PRE[
   The top-level MIME type (e.g., model/*[RFC2077]) determines what kind
   of content the type is, not what syntax it uses.  For example, agents
   using image/* to signal acceptance of any image format should
   certainly be given access to media type image/svg+xml, which is in
]PRE]

[PRE[
   all respects a standard image subtype.  It just happens to use XML to
   describe its syntax.  The two aspects of the media type are
   completely orthogonal.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   XML-based data types will most likely be registered in ALL top-level
   categories.  Potential, though currently unregistered, examples could
   include application/mathml+xml[MathML] and image/svg+xml[SVG].
]PRE]

A.4 Why not just have the MIME processor 'sniff' the content to
[PRE[
    determine whether it is XML?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Rather than explicitly labeling XML-based media types, the processor
   could look inside each type and see whether or not it is XML.  The
   processor could also cache a list of XML-based media types.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Although this method might work acceptably for some mail
   applications, it would fail completely in many other uses of MIME.
   For instance, an XML-based web crawler would have no way of
   determining whether a file is XML except to fetch it and check.  The
   same issue applies in some IMAP4[RFC2060] mail applications, where
   the client first fetches the MIME type as part of the message
   structure and then decides whether to fetch the MIME entity.
   Requiring these fetches just to determine whether the MIME type is
   XML could have significant bandwidth and latency disadvantages in
   many situations.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Sniffing XML also isn't as simple as it might seem.  DOCTYPE
   declarations aren't required, and they can appear fairly deep into a
   document under certain unpreventable circumstances.  (E.g., the XML
   declaration, comments, and processing instructions can occupy space
   before the DOCTYPE declaration.) Even sniffing the DOCTYPE isn't
   completely reliable, thanks to a variety of issues involving default
   values for namespaces within external DTDs and overrides inside the
   internal DTD.  Finally, the variety in potential character encodings
   (something XML provides tools to deal with), also makes reliable
   sniffing less likely.
]PRE]

A.5 Why not use a MIME parameter to specify that a media type uses XML
[PRE[
    syntax?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   For example, one could use "Content-Type: application/iotp;
   alternate-type=text/xml" or "Content-Type: application/iotp;
   syntax=xml".
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Section 5 of [RFC2045] says that "Parameters are modifiers of the
   media subtype, and as such do not fundamentally affect the nature of
   the content".  However, all XML-based media types are by their nature
]PRE]

[PRE[
   always XML.  Parameters, as they have been defined in the MIME
   architecture, are never invariant across all instantiations of a
   media type.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   More practically, very few if any MIME dispatchers and other MIME
   agents support dispatching off of a parameter.  While MIME agents on
   the receiving side will need to be updated in either case to support
   (or fall back to) generic XML processing, it has been suggested that
   it is easier to implement this functionality when acting off of the
   media type rather than a parameter.  More important, sending agents
   require no update to properly tag an image as "image/svg+xml", but
   few if any sending agents currently support always tagging certain
   content types with a parameter.
]PRE]

A.6 How about labeling with parameters in the other direction (e.g.,
[PRE[
    application/xml; Content-Feature=iotp)?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This proposal fails under the simplest case, of a user with neither
   knowledge of XML nor an XML-capable MIME dispatcher.  In that case,
   the user's MIME dispatcher is likely to dispatch the content to an
   XML processing application when the correct default behavior should
   be to dispatch the content to the application responsible for the
   content type (e.g., an ecommerce engine for
   application/iotp+xml[RFC2801], once this media type is registered).
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Note that even if the user had already installed the appropriate
   application (e.g., the ecommerce engine), and that installation had
   updated the MIME registry, many operating system level MIME
   registries such as .mailcap in Unix and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT in Windows
   do not currently support dispatching off a parameter, and cannot
   easily be upgraded to do so.  And, even if the operating system were
   upgraded to support this, each MIME dispatcher would also separately
   need to be upgraded.
]PRE]

A.7 How about a new superclass MIME parameter that is defined to apply
[PRE[
    to all MIME types (e.g., Content-Type: application/iotp;
    $superclass=xml)?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This combines the problems of Appendix A.5 and Appendix A.6.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   If the sender attaches an image/svg+xml file to a message and
   includes the instructions "Please copy the French text on the road
   sign", someone with an XML-aware MIME client and an XML browser but
   no support for SVG can still probably open the file and copy the
   text.  By contrast, with superclasses, the sender must add superclass
   support to her existing mailer AND the receiver must add superclass
   support to his before this transaction can work correctly.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   If the receiver comes to rely on the superclass tag being present and
   applications are deployed relying on that tag (as always seems to
   happen), then only upgraded senders will be able to interoperate with
   those receiving applications.
]PRE]

A.8 What about adding a new parameter to the Content-Disposition header
[PRE[
    or creating a new Content-Structure header to indicate XML syntax?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This has nearly identical problems to Appendix A.7, in that it
   requires both senders and receivers to be upgraded, and few if any
   operating systems and MIME dispatchers support working off of
   anything other than the MIME type.
]PRE]

A.9 How about a new Alternative-Content-Type header?

[PRE[
   This is better than Appendix A.8, in that no extra functionality
   needs to be added to a MIME registry to support dispatching of
   information other than standard content types.  However, it still
   requires both sender and receiver to be upgraded, and it will also
   fail in many cases (e.g., web hosting to an outsourced server), where
   the user can set MIME types (often through implicit mapping to file
   extensions), but has no way of adding arbitrary HTTP headers.
]PRE]

A.10 How about using a conneg tag instead (e.g., accept-features:
[PRE[
     (syntax=xml))?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   When the conneg protocol is fully defined, this may potentially be a
   reasonable thing to do.  But given the limited current state of
   conneg[RFC2703] development, it is not a credible replacement for a
   MIME-based solution.
]PRE]

A.11 How about a third-level content-type, such as text/xml/rdf?

[PRE[
   MIME explicitly defines two levels of content type, the top-level for
   the kind of content and the second-level for the specific media type.
   [RFC2048] extends this in an interoperable way by using prefixes to
   specify separate trees for IETF, vendor, and personal registrations.
   This specification also extends the two-level type by using the '
   +xml' suffix.  In both cases, processors that are unaware of these
   later specifications treat them as opaque and continue to
   interoperate.  By contrast, adding a third-level type would break the
   current MIME architecture and cause numerous interoperability
   failures.
]PRE]

A.12 Why use the plus ('+') character for the suffix '+xml'?

[PRE[
   As specified in Section 5.1 of [RFC2045], a tspecial can't be used:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   It was thought that "." would not be a good choice since it is
   already used as an additional hierarchy delimiter.  Also, "*" has a
   common wildcard meaning, and "-" and "_" are common word separators
   and easily confused.  The characters %'`#& are frequently used for
   quoting or comments and so are not ideal.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   That leaves: ~!$^+{}|

[PRE[
   Note that "-" is used heavily in the current registry.  "$" and "_"
   are used once each.  The others are currently unused.

[PRE[
   It was thought that '+' expressed the semantics that a MIME type can
   be treated (for example) as both scalable vector graphics AND ALSO as
   XML; it is both simultaneously.
]PRE]

A.13 What is the semantic difference between application/foo and
[PRE[
     application/foo+xml?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   MIME processors that are unaware of XML will treat the '+xml' suffix
   as completely opaque, so it is essential that no extra semantics be
   assigned to its presence.  Therefore, application/foo and
   application/foo+xml SHOULD be treated as completely independent media
   types.  Although, for example, text/calendar+xml could be an XML
   version of text/calendar[RFC2445], it is possible that this
   (hypothetical) new media type would include new semantics as well as
   new syntax, and in any case, there would be many applications that
   support text/calendar but had not yet been upgraded to support
   text/calendar+xml.
]PRE]

A.14 What happens when an even better markup language (e.g., EBML) is
[PRE[
     defined, or a new category of data?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   In the ten years that MIME has existed, XML is the first generic data
   format that has seemed to justify special treatment, so it is hoped
   that no further suffixes will be necessary.  However, if some are
   later defined, and these documents were also XML, they would need to
   specify that the '+xml' suffix is always the outermost suffix (e.g.,
   application/foo+ebml+xml not application/foo+xml+ebml).  If they were
   not XML, then they would use a regular suffix (e.g.,
   application/foo+ebml).
]PRE]

A.15 Why must I use the '+xml' suffix for my new XML-based media type?

[PRE[
   You don't have to, but unless you have a good reason to explicitly
   disallow generic XML processing, you should use the suffix so as not
   to curtail the options of future users and developers.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Whether the inventors of a media type, today, design it for dispatch
   to generic XML processing machinery (and most won't) is not the
   critical issue.  The core notion is that the knowledge that some
   media type happens to use XML syntax opens the door to unanticipated
   kinds of processing beyond those envisioned by its inventors, and on
   this basis identifying such encoding is a good and useful thing.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Developers of new media types are often tightly focused on a
   particular type of processing that meets current needs.  But there is
   no need to rule out generic processing as well, which could make your
   media type more valuable over time.  It is believed that registering
   with the '+xml' suffix will cause no interoperability problems
   whatsoever, while it may enable significant new functionality and
   interoperability now and in the future.  So, the conservative
   approach is to include the '+xml' suffix.

** Appendix B. Changes from RFC 2376

[PRE[
   There are numerous and significant differences between this
   specification and [RFC2376], which it obsoletes.  This appendix
   summarizes the major differences only.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   First, text/xml-external-parsed-entity and application/xml-external-
   parsed-entity are added as media types for external parsed entities,
   and text/xml and application/xml are now prohibited.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Second, application/xml-dtd is added as a media type for external DTD
   subsets and external parameter entities, and text/xml and
   application/xml are now prohibited.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Third, "utf-16le" and "utf-16be" are added.  RFC 2781 has introduced
   these BOM-less variations of the UTF-16 family.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Fourth, a naming convention ('+xml') for XML-based media types has
   been added, which also updates [RFC2048] as described in Section 7.
   By following this convention, an XML-based media type can be easily
   recognized as such.
