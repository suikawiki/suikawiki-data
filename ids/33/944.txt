> 5.195 Time of Operation
> Definition/Description: The “Time of Operation” field is
used to indicate the times of operation of a Facility or
Restriction.
> Source/Content: The times of operation are derived from
official government source. Each “Time of Operation”
group contains the definition of a daily period of operations
within a calendar week.
The first two positions identify days of the week, with
Monday equal to 1 and Sunday equal to 7. A single day, for
example, Monday, is depicted as “01”. A consecutive series
of days, for example Monday through Friday, is depicted as
“15”. Non-consecutive days require multiple Time of
Operation entries. The remaining 8 characters define a
starting time of four characters and an ending time of four
characters. These times are in the format HHMM (H=
hours, M= minutes) using a 24 hour time system. For
example, 00012350 starts at one minute after midnight and
ends at 10 minutes before midnight. 07152000 starts at
07:15 hours and ends at 20:00 hours.
> Times of Operation can also be expressed in terms of
Sunrise (SR) and Sunset (SS). When a “Time of Operation”
is defined as starting at or ending at Sunrise, that time is
specified as “000R”. When a “Time of Operation” is
defined as starting at or ending at Sunset, that time is
specified as “000S”. When a “Time of Operation” is
defined as starting at or ending at a certain number of
hours/minutes before or after Sunrise or Sunset, those times
are specified as in the following examples:
> 030R for 30 minutes before Sunrise or R030 for 30
minutes after Sunrise.
> 100R for 1 hour before Sunrise or R100 for 1 hour
after Sunrise.
> 030S for 30 minutes before Sunset or S030 for 30
minutes after Sunset.
> 100S for 1 hour before Sunset or S100 for 1 hour after
Sunset
> Of the three digits associated with “R” or “S,” the first
is an expression of hours, the second and third an
expression of minutes. 1 hour, 30 minutes would be
130, 2 hours, 15 minutes would be 215, etc. 
> When multiple definitions are required to fully define the
“Time of Operation” for a given calendar week, these are
coded as second and subsequent “Time of Operation”
fields.
> Examples:
> A restriction valid on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays only, 0700 to 1700, would require three “Time
of Operation” entries, one for 01 (Monday), one for 03
(Wednesday), one for 05 (Friday) and would be
expressed as 0107001700 0307001700 0507001700.
> A continuous restriction, starting on Monday at 0700
and ending on Friday at 1700 would require three
“Time of Operation” entries, one for Monday of
0107002359, one for Tuesday through Thursday of
2400002359 and one for Friday of 0500001700.
> When the times to be defined go over midnight, the second
four characters of time information are valid on the actual
ending day. For example, a “Time of Operation” of Monday
through Friday, 1700 to 0300 actually ends on Saturday and
would be shown as 1617000300, not 1517000300.
