> Time4J is thought as a complete and high-end replacement for old java classes around java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar and java.text.SimpleDateFormat. This project is also intended as first-class alternative to the popular libraries JodaTime and its successor JSR-310 (Threeten) since the target audience of Time4J will not only be business Java developers, but also developers with a more scientific background (for example extended time scale support including leap seconds or historically accurate dates).

> This project is a specialized version of Time4J-v3.x (using the branch level6 - starting with version v3.5) and distributes an AAR-library suitable for the Android platform. It is not modularized like Time4J itself, but its (single) artifact "time4j-android" replaces the Time4J-modules "core", "i18n", "calendar", "olson" and "tzdata". Hence the only Time4J-modules which might be combined with this AAR-library are just "misc" and "range" if needed.
