> Typeson adds a metadata property $types to the result that maps each non-trivial property to a type name. (In the case of arrays or encoded primitives, a new object will instead be created with a $ property that can be preserved by JSON.) The type name is a reference to a registered type specification that you need to have the same on both the stringifying and the parsing side.
