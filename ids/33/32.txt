> The JSON-Base64 file format, aka JB64, was invented for performing clean data transfers of database records and spreadsheet values across a wide variety of Internet hosts, software programs, and programming languages. JB64 is encoded in a stream-ready format, follows a clearly defined specification, and the file format and reference implementations are public domain.
