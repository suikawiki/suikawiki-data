> HyperGraphQL is a GraphQL interface for querying and serving linked data on the Web. It is designed to support federated querying and exposing data from multiple linked data services using GraphQL query language and schemas. The core of the response is a JSON-LD object, which extends the standard JSON with the JSON-LD context enabling semantic disambiguation of the contained data.
