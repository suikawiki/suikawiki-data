> Hyphenator.js is a free open source Javascript library that automatically hyphenates text on websites. It comes in handy as a polyfill for legacy browsers that don't support CSS 3 hyphenation at all or for modern browsers that do hyphenation, but do not provide hyphenation dictionaries for a particular language.
