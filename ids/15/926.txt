> VIQR stands for VIetnamese Quoted-Readable, which is a convention to write Vietnamese letters using 7-bit ASCII. This convention arises from the need to exchange Vietnamese messages in 7-bit environments such as email or the soc.culture.vietnamese newsgroup in the Internet. For this reason VIQR is also known as Vietnet convention.
