> The NLP Interchange Format (NIF) is an RDF/OWL-based format that aims to achieve interoperability between Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, language resources and annotations. NIF consists of specifications, ontologies and software (overview), which are combined under the version identifier "NIF 2.0", but are versioned individually.

> This specification complements the NIF 2.0 Core specification by specifying in detail how the interface for a NIF implementation must behave. The focus here is on how to access the tools and web services and not on what the transfered data contains. We distinguish Web Service (NIF-WS) and Command Line Interface (NIF-CLI) which are called in sum NIF implementations. Note that only the parameter input is required during a request. If this document mentions "required" parameters, it means that in order to be introperable with other NIF implementations and clients, you are required to implement this parameter in your NIF implementation.
