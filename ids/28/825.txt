> If you want to save a key and later load it with SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file, then you must set the OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE flag on the key. You do that by calling EC_KEY_set_asn1_flag(ecKey, OPENSSL_EC_NAMED_CURVE). Failure to do so will result in a SSL error of 0x1408a0c1 (no shared cipher) at the server.
