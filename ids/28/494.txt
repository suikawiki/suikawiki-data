> debugger.html is a hackable debugger for modern times, built from the ground up using React and Redux. It is designed to be approachable, yet powerful. And it is engineered to be predictable, understandable, and testable.
> Mozilla created this debugger for use in the Firefox Developer Tools. And we've purposely created this project in Github, using modern toolchains. We hope to not only to create a great debugger that works with the Firefox and Chrome Debugging Protocol but development community that can embed this debugger in your own projects with tools like NPM.
