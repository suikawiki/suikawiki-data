> The internet, less than an arm's length away! WIB, the Android Wear Internet Browser, is a full fledged web browser running on your Android Wear smartwatch. Bookmarks can easily be added directly from your watch. WIB works even when your phone is off if you have a smartwatch with Android Wear 5.1 and WiFi! One of the must have tools for wearables.
