> This document defines an encoding of RDF graphs called another RDF encoding form (aREF). The encoding combines and simpilfies parts of existing RDF serializations Turtle, JSON-LD, and RDF/JSON. In contrast to these formats, RDF data in aREF is not serialized as a Unicode string but encoded as a list-map-structure, as known from the type system of most programming languages and from data structuring languages such as JSON and YAML.
