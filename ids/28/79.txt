> The Cesidian Root is a global Internet that was started on 30 September 2005 by the Hon Most Rev Dr Cesidio Tallini, Governor of the UMMOA/AMOMU, and Massimiliano Mastrocinque, a brilliant Italian IT. The Cesidian Root was started for the benefit of Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Worlders, who wish to utilise this resource for reasons of independence and/or national security. VIPs and DNS technicians also utilise this root for the same or similar reasons.

> Today the Cesidian Root is a full working Intercontinental Internet carrying the entire contents of 5 roots: the ICANN (267 TLDs), the Cesidian Root proper (23 TLDs), the China MII Root (3 TLDs), the Arabic GCC Root (4 TLDs), and the i-DNS.net Root (19 TLDs). It resolves the typical ICANN domains you are used to resolving in your browser, but it also resolves the unique Independent Long Island .ILI TLD, and even odd TLDs in Chinese, Russian, and Arabic scripts. We also manage spam free email through the Cesidian Root.
