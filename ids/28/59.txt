> IST is often used as the reason why Indians are always late in India. This is most definitely true as well. Indians are late to all social gatherings and everything in between. Indian Standard Time is when a party starts at 5 P.M. and an Indian arrives at 6:30, eats food and leaves shortly after.

> Indians joke about IST as Indian Stretchable Time since people generally do not stick to time and scheduled events do not follow the timetable that was first set up.'''['''20''']'''
> IST "Indian Standard Time" can also jokingly refer to arriving late to Indian gatherings or the late start of Indian events.'''['''21''']''' For example, if a concert is scheduled to being at 7:00 PM, often it will begin no earlier than 8:00 PM, a.k.a. "7:00 PM, IST".
> Both of the above apply to some extent to Malaysia and Malaysian standard time BTW 203.109.240.93 15:13, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
