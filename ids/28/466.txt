> In this section we offer instructions for creating an XML representation for OSLC Defined Resources. The resultant XML representations are designed to validate as RDF/XML and therefore are often referred to as "constrained RDF/XML" or "abbreviated RDF/XML" representations, however the main intent of these instructions is to document a specific XML representation format for use in scenarios where a more unfettered RDF/XML representation or use of RDF/XML toolkits is not appropriate or preferred. OSLC domain specifications SHOULD refer to these instructions when requiring application/xml representations.
> XML representations returned by OSLC Defined Resources SHOULD be:
> Returned when these content types requested: application/xml
> Returned as content-type: application/xml

> A second serializer is provided using several of the RDF/XML abbreviations to provide a more compact readable format, at the cost of some pre-processing. This is suitable for small documents.

> Transform the RDF to HTML, e.g. for the Reporting Data Dictionary, this is done in two steps. First, the Turtle file is converted using Jena to dd-vocabulary.rdf which contains non-abbreviated RDF/XML. Second, the RDF/XML is converted using XSLT to the HTML file dd-vocabulary.html. See below for an Ant script and XSLT file to automate this process.

> Set the Accept HTTP header to define the media type in which you want to get the resource representation. Possible values for the media types are as follows:
> application/xml to get an abbreviated RDF/XML representation of the resource.
> application/rdf+xml to get an expanded RDF/XML representation of the resource.
> If you do not specify this header, you get a resource represented in abbreviated RDF/XML format by default.
