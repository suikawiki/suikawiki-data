> Fast: KaTeX renders its math synchronously and doesn’t need to reflow the page.
> Print quality: KaTeX’s layout is based on Donald Knuth’s TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.
> Self contained: KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.
> Server side rendering: KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.
