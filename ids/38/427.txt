Formally, a segmented name string of type [VAR[T]]
it's a segment of type [VAR[T]],
followed by zero or more sequences of
combinations of a separator of type [VAR[T]] and a segment of type [VAR[T]].

[3] A segment of type [VAR[T]] is a string of one or more non-space characters
that is not a punctuation of type [VAR[T]].

[4] A punctuation of type [VAR[T]] is one of the punctuation list
for [VAR[T]].
