The [DFN@en[[CITE[Segmented Name Strings]]]] specification
defines several syntaxes representing names and their 
segment boundaries.

[12] This specification depends on the [CITE[[[Infra Standard]]]].
The terms
[[code point]],
[[ASCII lower alpha]],
[[list]],
and
[[is empty]]
are defined by the [CITE[Infra Standard]].

* General definition

[2] A [DFN[segmented name string]] is a space-separated list of 
one or more substrings, representing a name and implied boundaries
within it.

[5] 
Formally, a segmented name string of type [VAR[T]]
is a segment of type [VAR[T]],
followed by zero or more sequences of
combinations of a separator of type [VAR[T]] and a segment of type [VAR[T]].

[3] A segment of type [VAR[T]] is a string of one or more non-space characters
that is not a punctuation of type [VAR[T]].
There might be [VAR[T]]-dependent additional restrictions.

[4] A punctuation of type [VAR[T]] is one of the [[list]],
referred to as the punctuation list for [VAR[T]].

[6] A separator of type [VAR[T]] is either a space, or
a space followed by a punctuation of type [VAR[T]] followed by a space.
A separator that is a space represents an implied boundary,
e.g. hyphenation point.
A separator that contains a punctuation represents an explicit
boundary whose type is denoted by the punctuation.

[7] A space is a [CODE[U+0020]] [CODE(charname)@en[SPACE]] character.

[8] A character is a [[code point]].

* East Asian names

[9] A [DFN[segmented East Asian name string]] is a type of [[segmented name string]].

[10] A segment of [[segmented East Asian name string]] is a string
of one or more characters from:

- [[CJK Unified Ideographs]]
- [[CJK Compatibility Ideographs]]
-
@@ and more

[11] The punctuation list for [[segmented East Asian name string]]
[[is empty]].

* Hiragana names

[13] A [DFN[segmented Hiragana name string]] is a type of [[segmented name string]].

[14] A segment of [[segmented Hiragana name string]] is a string 
of one or more characters from:

- [[Hiragana]]
- [CODE[ー]]

@@ Need more formal definition.

[15] The punctuation list of [[segmented Hiragana name string]]
[[is empty]].

* Romaji names

[16] A [DFN[segmented Romaji name string]] is a type of [[segmented name string]].

[17] A segment of [[segmented Romaji name string]] is a string 
of one or more characters from:

- [[ASCII lower alpha]]
- [CODE[ā]], [CODE[ī]], [CODE[ū]], [CODE[ē]], [CODE[ō]]

@@ Need more formal definition.

[18] The punctuation list of [[segmented Romaji name string]]
is a [[list]] of
[CODE[-]] and [CODE[']].
