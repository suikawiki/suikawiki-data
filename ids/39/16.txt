Dhall is a programmable configuration language optimized for maintainability.
>
You can think of Dhall as: JSON + functions + types + imports
>
Note that while Dhall is programmable, Dhall is not Turing-complete. Many of Dhall's features take advantage of this restriction to provide stronger safety guarantees and more powerful tooling.
