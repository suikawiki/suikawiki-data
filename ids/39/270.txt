> StrictMark is a rational [I[subset]] of Markdown that implements all the features with the shortest [I[formal]] grammar possible. Hence, uniform syntax and no ambiguities. The idea is that StrictMark can reuse all the existing Markdown support, without sharing the weight of the legacy syntax and its incidental complexity.
> StrictMark is Markdown, refactored.
