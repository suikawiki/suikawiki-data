[1] [CITE@en[GitHub - d3x0r/JSOX: JavaScript Object eXchange format; extended JSON/JSON6]], [TIME[2021-10-04T08:31:47.000Z]] <https://github.com/d3x0r/JSOX>

>
100% Compatible reader for JSON. JSOX.stringify cannot generate JSON compatible output; it would lose all the features anyway; use existing [CODE[JSON.stringify()]] if required, all JSON(JSON3/JSON5/JSON6) is valid JSOX.
>
JSOX adds Map, BigInt, Date, and TypeArray transport support, cyclic objects, and includes keywords (5)'Infinity', (5)'NaN', (6)'undefined'.
>
JSOX adds optional processing of [CODE[typed]] data. Type names can be applied to Objects, Arrays and Strings. Type names are defined and provided with to/from JSOX handlers by users of this library. The data, decoded as the object '{}', array '[]', or string '""' is passed to the fromJSOX handler, and the resulting value returned as the decoded object.
