> HTTP Long Polling:  The server attempts to "hold open" (not
>       immediately reply to) each HTTP request, responding only when
>       there are events to deliver.  In this way, there is always a
>       pending request to which the server can reply for the purpose of
>       delivering events as they occur, thereby minimizing the latency in
>       message delivery.
