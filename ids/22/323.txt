* DocumentIndex

[2] A DocumentIndex is a scalar value used to identify a source data stream.  It must be a true value.  A positive integer should be used.

[3] The value [CODE[-1]] represents that the source is an unknown data stream.

* CharacterIndex

[4] A CharacterIndex is a non-negative integer representing the location of a character in the given source character stream.  It is the offset from the beginning of the character string.

;; [5] It is unclear whether "an unknown character index" is necessary or not at the time of writing.  If necessary, the value [CODE[-1]] will be used.

* IndexedString

[1] An IndexedString is either:

- a scalar reference to a character string
- a reference to an array of zero or more references
to an array of a character string, a DocumentIndex, and a CharacterIndex;
The two index values identify the source location of the first character of the character string.
