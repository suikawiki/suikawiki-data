* DocumentIndex

[2] A DocumentIndex is a scalar value used to identify a source data stream.  It must be a true value.  A positive integer should be used.

[3] The value [CODE[-1]] represents that the source is an unknown data stream.

* CharacterIndex

[4] A CharacterIndex is a non-negative integer representing the location of a character in the given source character stream.  It is the offset from the beginning of the character string.

;; [5] It is unclear whether "an unknown character index" is necessary or not at the time of writing.  If necessary, the value [CODE[-1]] will be used.

* IndexedStringSegment

[6] An IndexedStringSegment is an array reference containing a character string,
a DocumentIndex, and a CharacterIndex.

[7] The pair of the DocumentIndex and the CharacterIndex identifies the source
location of the first character of the character string.

[8] An IndexedStringSegment represents the character string.

* IndexedString

[1] An IndexedString is an array reference containing zero or more IndexedStringSegment,
representing a string consist of concatenation of strings represented by
the IndexedStringSegments, in order.
