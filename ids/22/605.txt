> Shadow DOM spec should be considered as Living Standard, as HTML spec and DOM spec have already adapted Living Standard model. That hasn't changed.
> Although you could read v1 as version 1, please don't take it seriously. We, browser vendors, need a good terminology which represents something that all of us can agree to implement. v1 is a convenient term for that.
> If you are uncomfortable for a term of v1, you can think it as p1, priority 1. Actually, I am using a label of v1 when I label an issue which must be resolved asap so that other browser vendors can agree and start to implement Shadow DOM. There is no extra meaning.
