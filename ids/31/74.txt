> Properties beginning with mp- are reserved as a mechanism for clients to give commands to servers. Where typically properties of a post are visible to users, commands to the server are not visible to users, so it does not make sense to set a property on the post for a command. Clients and servers wishing to experiment with creating new mp- commands are encouraged to brainstorm and document implementations at indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions.
