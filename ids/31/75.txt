> If the target also provides a shortlink, or if it syndicated the post to another location, the Micropub endpoint may return additional URLs using the HTTP Link header, along with an appropriate "rel" value. For example, it can return the short URL of a post by responding with:
> Link: <http://aaron.pk/xxxxx>; rel="shortlink"
> or can include the location of the syndicated post with:
> Link: <https://myfavoritesocialnetwork.example/aaronpk/xxxxxx>; rel="syndication"
