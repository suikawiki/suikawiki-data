:c: Country
:t: System of time in actual use
:w: Difference from Washington standard

:c: [[Agrentina]]
:t:
The official time in use throughout the Argentine
Republic is referred to the meridian of Cordoba,
4[SUP[h]] 16[SUP[m]] 48.2[SUP[s]] west from Greenwich.  At 11 a. m.
a daily signal is telegraphed from the Cordoba
Observatory. The greatest deviation of local
mean time from the official time would not ex-
ceed 28 minutes. La Plata is 25[SUP[m]] 45[SUP[s]] east from
Cordoba. and Mendoza, the most western town
of importance, is 18[SUP[m]] 32[SUP[s]] west from Cordoba.
:w: +0.43.11.8

:c: [[Austria-Hungary]]
:t:
Standard time does not exist in Austria except
for the service of the railroads. Central Euro-
pean time, 15° east from Greenwich, is required
to be used by all the railways. This is not a
matter of law, but is in force by order of the
proper authorities.
:w: +06:00:00

:c: [[Belgium]]
:t:
Official time in Belgium is calculated from 0 to 24
hours, zero corresponding to mean midnight at
Greenwich. The Royal Observatory at Brus-
sels communicates twice daily the precise hour
to the central telegraphic administration and
Government offices, also to important corpora-
tions. The telegraphic administration trans-
mits it to the other towns in Belgium.
:w: +05:00:00

:c: [[China]]
:t:
An observatory is maintained by the Jesuit mis-
sion at Zikawei, near Shanghai, and a large ball
suspended from a mast on the French bund in
Shanghai is dropped electrically precisely at
noon each day. This furnishes the local time
at the port of Shanghai, which is adopted by
the railway and telegraph companies repre-
sented there, as well as by the coastwise ship-
ping. From Shaiighai the time is telegraphed
to other ports. The cable companies repre
sented in Peking receive this time from Chefoo:
the Imperial Chinese telegraphs from the office
of that company in Tientsin. The imperial
railways of north China use the same time,
taking it from the British gun at Tientsin and
passing it on to the stations of the railway twice
each day at 8 a. m. and 8 p. m. No information
yet from the Peking-Hankow Railway.
:w: +13:04:43.3

:c: [[Colombia]]
:t:
At Bogota the time used is that of the meridian of
Bogota. This time is taken every day at noon
in the observatory, but there is no method em-
ployed in correcting this time daily by signal
from a central observatory. Some few people,
such as jewelers go to the observatory daily:
but the great mass of business men, railroad
officials, etc., let their time run sometimes for
weeks without correcting it, until the incon-
veniences caused thereby compel them to make
the necessary corrections. As far as communi-
cating the time as corrected in Bogota to other
parts of the country is concerned this is ren-
dered impossible by the very poor telegraph
service, it frequently taking four and five days
to send messages a distance of from 50 to 100
miles.
:w: +00:03:05.8

:c: 
[[Costa Rica]]
:t:
The Government has established an observatory
at the capital. San Jose, in latitude 9° 56' north,
longitude 84° 04' 14" west from Greenwich; alti-
tude, 4,567 feet, or 1,160 meters, above sea level.
The Greenwich meridian is used exclusively to
regulate observatory time, which is corrected
by observation and reduced to mean time. This
time is issued to public offices, railway and tele-
graph offices, churches, and to all residents
whose occupations necessitate correct time.
There is no method employed to correct time
by signal from the observatory, the corrected
time being taken by applicants"from the stand-
ard chronometer at the observatory.
:w: -00:36:13.1

:c: [[Cuba]]
:t:
The official time of the Republic is civil mean time
of the meridian of Habana, and is used by the
railroads and telegraphic lines of the Govern-
ment. The central meteorological station gives
the time daily to the port and city of Havana as
well as to all the telegraph offices of the Re-
public.
