:t: System of time in actual use
:w: Difference from Washington standard

:c: [[Agrentina]]
:t:
The official time in use throughout the Argentine
Republic is referred to the meridian of Cordoba,
4[SUP[h]] 16[SUP[m]] 48.2[SUP[s]] west from Greenwich.  At 11 a. m.
a daily signal is telegraphed from the Cordoba
Observatory. The greatest deviation of local
mean time from the official time would not ex-
ceed 28 minutes. La Plata is 25[SUP[m]] 45[SUP[s]] east from
Cordoba. and Mendoza, the most western town
of importance, is 18[SUP[m]] 32[SUP[s]] west from Cordoba.
:w: +0.43.11.8

:c: [[Austria-Hungary]]
:t:
Standard time does not exist in Austria except
for the service of the railroads. Central Euro-
pean time, 15° east from Greenwich, is required
to be used by all the railways. This is not a
matter of law, but is in force by order of the
proper authorities.
:w: +06:00:00

:c: [[Belgium]]
:t:
Official time in Belgium is calculated from 0 to 24
hours, zero corresponding to mean midnight at
Greenwich. The Royal Observatory at Brus-
sels communicates twice daily the precise hour
to the central telegraphic administration and
Government offices, also to important corpora-
tions. The telegraphic administration trans-
mits it to the other towns in Belgium.
:w: +05:00:00

:c: [[China]]
:t:
An observatory is maintained by the Jesuit mis-
sion at Zikawei, near Shanghai, and a large ball
suspended from a mast on the French bund in
Shanghai is dropped electrically precisely at
noon each day. This furnishes the local time
at the port of Shanghai, which is adopted by
the railway and telegraph companies repre-
sented there, as well as by the coastwise ship-
ping. From Shaiighai the time is telegraphed
to other ports. The cable companies repre
sented in Peking receive this time from Chefoo:
the Imperial Chinese telegraphs from the office
of that company in Tientsin. The imperial
railways of north China use the same time,
taking it from the British gun at Tientsin and
passing it on to the stations of the railway twice
each day at 8 a. m. and 8 p. m. No information
yet from the Peking-Hankow Railway.
:w: +13:04:43.3

:c: [[Colombia]]
:t:
At Bogota the time used is that of the meridian of
Bogota. This time is taken every day at noon
in the observatory, but there is no method em-
ployed in correcting this time daily by signal
from a central observatory. Some few people,
such as jewelers go to the observatory daily:
but the great mass of business men, railroad
officials, etc., let their time run sometimes for
weeks without correcting it, until the incon-
veniences caused thereby compel them to make
the necessary corrections. As far as communi-
cating the time as corrected in Bogota to other
parts of the country is concerned this is ren-
dered impossible by the very poor telegraph
service, it frequently taking four and five days
to send messages a distance of from 50 to 100
miles.

:c: 
[[Costa Rica]]
:t:
The Government has established an observatory
at the capital. San Jose, in latitude 9° 56' north,
longitude 84° 04' 14" west from Greenwich; alti-
tude, 4,567 feet, or 1,160 meters, above sea level.
The Greenwich meridian is used exclusively to
regulate observatory time, which is corrected
by observation and reduced to mean time. This
time is issued to public offices, railway and tele-
graph offices, churches, and to all residents
whose occupations necessitate correct time.
There is no method employed to correct time
by signal from the observatory, the corrected
time being taken by applicants"from the stand-
ard chronometer at the observatory.

:c: [[Cuba]]
:t:
The official time of the Republic is civil mean time
of the meridian of Habana, and is used by the
railroads and telegraphic lines of the Govern-
ment. The central meteorological station gives
the time daily to the port and city of Havana as
well as to all the telegraph offices of the Re-
public.

Standard time is that of the thirtieth meridian
east from Greenwich (eastern European time)
and is therefore 2 hours fast of Greenwich or
west European time and 1 hour fast of central
European time. It is sent out electrically by

By royal decree of September 14, 1895. the time
in common use is that of the mean time of
Athens, which is transmitted from the observ-
atory by telegraph every day to all towns.

[BOX[
The local time of Amsterdam (5[SUP[h]] 19[SUP[m]] 39[SUP[s]] later) is
generally used, but Greenwich (5[SUP[h]] later) time
is used by the post and telegraph administra-
tion and the railways and other transportation
companies. The observatory at Leyden com-
municates the time twice a day to Amsterdam,
The Hague, Rotterdam, and other cities, and
the telegraph bureau at Amsterdam signals
the time to all the other telegraph bureaus
every morning. In the Grand Duchy of Lux-
emburg central European time is the legal and
uniform time.

[BOX[
In Honduras the half hour nearest to the merid-
ian of Tegucigalpa, longitude 87° 12' west from
Greenwich, is generally used; said hour is fre-
quently determined at the national institute by
means of a solar chronometer and communi-
cated by telephone to the industrial school,
where, in turn, it is indicated to the public by
a steam whistle. The central telegraph office
communicates it to the various suboffices of
the Republic, whose clocks serve as a basis for
the time of the villages, and in this manner an
approximately uniform time is established
throughout the Republic.

:c: [[Italy]]
:t:
Mean solar time of the fifteenth meridian east
from Greenwich is the standard time adopted
by royal decree of August 10, 1893. for the
kingdom of Italy. This time is to be kept in
all Government establishments, offices, dock
yards, and is to be used by all ships of the
Italian navy in the ports of or doing duty on
the coast of Italy. All railroads, post and tele-
graph offices, and Italian coasting steamers are
to use this time and regulate their business and
time-tables in accordance therewith. The
hours run from midnight to midnight that is
to say, in Italy 1 p. m. is thirteen hours, 5 p. m.
is seventeen hours, etc.

Imperial ordinance No. 51 of 1886: “The merid-
ian that passes through the observatory at
Greenwich, England, shall he the zero (0) me-
ridian. Longitude shall be counted from the
above meridian east and west up to 180°, the
east being positive and the west negative.
From January 1, 1888, the time of the one hun-
dred and thirty-fifth degree east longitude
shall be the standard time of Japan.”
+14:00:00

Imperial ordinance No. 167 of 1895: “The standard
time hitherto used in Japan shall henceforth be
called central standard time. The time of 120°
east longitude shall be the standard time of
Formosa, the Pescadores, the Yayeyama, and
the Miyako groups, and shall be called western
standard time. This ordinance shall take effect
from the 1st of January, 1896.”

[BOX[
Tokyo time (135° east from Greenwich) is tele-
graphed daily to the Imperial Japanese post
and telegraph office at Seoul. This is corrected
by subtracting 30 minutes, which nearly repre-
sents the difference in longitude, and is then
used by the railroads, street railways, and post
and telegraph offices, and most or the better
classes. In the country districts the people use
sun dials to some extent.

:c: [[Mexico]]
:t:
[BOX[
The National astronomical observatory, of Tacu-
baya, regulates a pendulum twice a day, which
marks the local mean time of the City of Mex-
ico (6[SUP[h]] 36[SUP[m]] 31.6[SUP[s]] west from Greenwich), and a
signal is raised twice a week, at noon, upon the
roof of the national palace, such signal being
used to regulate the city's public clock. This
signal, the clock at the central telegraph office,
and the public clock on the cathedral serve as a
basis for the time used commonly by the peo-
ple. The general telegraph office transmits this
time daily to all of its branch offices. Not every
city in the country uses this time, however, as
a local time, very imperfectly determined, is
more commonly observed.

The following railroad companies use standard
City of Mexico time, corrected daily by tele-
graph: Central, Hidalgo, Xico, and San Rafael,
National, Mexican. The Central Railroad cor-
rects its time daily by means of the noon signal
sent out from the Naval Observatory at Wash-
ington, converted into City of Mexico time, and
by a similar signal from the observatory at St.
Louis, Mo.

:t:
There is no Government observatory, but the
meridian of Managua is governed by the time
of Corinto, the longitude of which is 87° 12' 81"
west from Greenwich, giving for Managua lon-
gitude 86° 17' 30". Managua time, thus ascer-
tained, is issued to all public offices, railways,
telegraph offices, and churches in a zone that
extends from San Juan del Sur, latitude 11° 15'
44" north, to El Ocotal, latitude 12° 46' north,
and from El Castillo, longitude 84° 22' 37" west,
to Corinto. The time of the Atlantic ports is
usually obtained from the captains of ships.
:w: -00:45:10

:c: [[Panama]]
:t:
The railroad company uses the local mean time
of Colon, corrected by steamers' chronometers
(5[SUP[h]] 19[SUP[m]] 39[SUP[s]] west from Greenwich). The Central
and South American Telegraph Company now
cables seventy-fifth meridian time (75° west
from Greenwich) daily from Washington, and
this will probably be adopted as the standard.
