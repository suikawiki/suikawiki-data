[I[Greman East Africa]], 2 h. fast or 2h. 30m. fast.


[I[Korea]], 8 h. 30 m. fast. Central standard time of Japan is telegraphed 
daily to the Imperial Japanese Post and Telegraph Office at Seoul. 
Before December, 1904, this was corrected by subtracting 30 m., 
which nearly represents the difference in longitude, and was then 
used by the railroads, street railways, and post and telegraph offices, 
and most of the better classes. Since December 1, 1904, the Jap- 
anese post-offices and railways in Korea have begun to use central 
standard time of Japan. In the country districts the people use 
sundials to some extent.

The following table is taken, by permission, largely 
from the abstracts of official reports given in Vol. IV, 
Appendix IV of the Publications of the United States 
Naval Observatory, 1905. The time given is fast or slow 
as compared with Greenwich mean solar time. 

[I[Argentina]], 4 h. 16 m. 48.2 s. slow. Official time is referred to the merid- 
ian of Cordoba. At 11 o'clock, a.m., a daily signal is telegraphed 
from the Cordoba Observatory. 

[I[Austria-Hungary]], 1 h. fast. Standard time does not exist except for 
the service of railroads where it is in force, not by law, but by order 
of the proper authorities. 

[I[Belgium]]. Official time is calculated from to 24 hours, zero corre- 
sponding to midnight at Greenwich. The Royal Observatory at 
Brussels communicates daily the precise hour by telegraph. 

[I[British Empire]].

[I[Great Britain]]. The meridian of Greenwich is the standard time 
meridian for England, Isle of Man, Orkneys, Shetland Islands, 
and Scotland. 

[I[Ireland]], 0 h. 25 m. 21.1 s. slow. The meridian of Dublin is the 
standard time meridian.

[I[New Zealand]], 11 h. 30 m. fast. 

[I[India]]. Local mean time of the Madras Observatory, 5 h. 20 m. 59.1 s., 
is practically used as standard time for India and Ceylon, being 
telegraphed daily all over the country; but for strictly local use it 
is generally converted into local mean time. It is proposed soon 
to adopt the standard time of 5 h. 30 m. fast of Greenwich for India 
and Ceylon, and 6 h. 30 m. fast of Greenwich for Burmah.

Chile, 4 h. 42 m. 46.1 s. slow. The official railroad time is furnished by 
the Santiago Observatory. It is telegraphed over the country daily 
at 7 o'clock, a.m. The city of Valparaiso uses the local time, 4 h. 
46 h. 34.1 m. slow, of the observatory at the Naval School located 
there.

TIME USED IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES 83 

China. An observatory is maintained by the Jesuit mission at 
Zikawei near Shanghai, and a time ball suspended from a mast on 
the French Bund in Shanghai is dropped electrically precisely at 
noon each day. This furnishes the local time at the port of 
Shanghai 8 h. 5 m. 43.3 s. fast, which is adopted by the railway and 
telegraph companies represented there, as well as by the coastwise 
shipping. From Shanghai the time is telegraphed to other ports. 
The Imperial Railways of North China use the same time, taking 
it from the British gun at Tientsin and passing it on to the stations 
of the railway twice each day, at 8 o'clock a.m. and at 8 o'clock p.m. 
Standard time, 7 h. and 8 h. fast, is coming into use all along the 
east coast of China from Newchwang to Hongkong. 

Colombia. Local mean time is used at Bogota, 4 h. 56 m. 54.2 s. slow, 
taken every day at noon in the observatory. The lack of effective 
telegraphic service makes it impossible to communicate the time 
as corrected at Bogota to other parts of the country, it frequently 
taking four and five days to send messages a distance of from 50 to 
100 miles. 

Costa Rica, 5 h. 36 m. 16.9 s. slow. This is the local mean time of the 
Government Observatory at San Jose". 

Cuba, 5 h. 29 m. 26 s. slow. The official time of the Republic is the civil 
mean time of the meridian of Havana and is used by the railroads 
and telegraph lines of the government. The Central Meteorological 
Station gives the time daily to the port and city of Havana as well 
as to all the telegraph offices of the Republic. 

Denmark, 1 h. fast. In Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the Danish 
West Indies, local mean time is used. 

Egypt, 2 h. fast. Standard time is sent out electrically by the standard 
clock of the observatory to the citadel at Cairo, to Alexandria, Port 
Said and Wady-Halfa. 

Equador, 5 h. 14 m. 6.7 s. slow. The official time is that of the meridian 
of Quito, corrected daily from the National Observatory. 

France, h. 9 m. 20.9 s. fast. Legal time in France, Algeria and Tunis is 
local mean time of the Paris Observatory. Local mean time is 
considered legal in other French colonies. 

German Empire. 
Germany, 1 h. fast. 
Kiaochau, 8 h. fast. 
Southwest Africa, 1 h. fast. 

It is proposed to adopt standard time for the following: 
Bismarck Archipelago, Carolines, Mariane Islands and New* Guinea, 
10 fast.

84 LONGITUDE AND TIME 

German East Africa, 2 h. fast or 2 h. 30 m. fast. 
Kamerun, 1 h. fast. 

Samoa (after an understanding with the U. S.), 12 h. fast. 
Toga, Greenwich time. 

Greece, 1 h. 34 m. 52.9 s. fast. By royal decree of September 14, 1895, the 
time in common use is that of the mean time of Athens, which is 
transmitted from the observatory by telegraph to the towns of 
the kingdom. 

Holland. The local time of Amsterdam, Oh. 19 m. 32.3 s. fast, is 
generally used, but Greenwich time is used by the post and telegraph 
administration and the railways and other transportation com- 
panies. The observatory at Leyden communicates the time twice 
a week to Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and other cities, 
and the telegraph bureau at Amsterdam signals the time to all 
the other telegraph bureaus every morning. 

Honduras. In Honduras the half hour nearest to the meridian of 
Tegucigalpa, longitude 87° 12' west from Greenwich, is generally 
used. Said hour, 6 h. slow, is frequently determined at the National 
Institute by means of a solar chronometer and communicated by 
telephone to the Industrial School, where in turn it is indicated to 
the public by a steam whistle. The central telegraph office com- 
municates it to tho various sub-offices of the Republic, whose 
clocks generally serve as a basis for the time of the villages, and in 
this manner an approximately uniform time is established through- 
out the Republic. 

Italy, 1 h. fast. Adopted by royal decree of August 10, 1893. This 
time is kept in all government establishments, ships of the Italian 
Navy in the ports of Italy, railroads, telegraph offices, and Italian 
coasting steamers. The hours are numbered from to 24, 
beginning with midnight. 

Japan. Imperial ordinance No. 51, of 1886: "The meridian that 
passes through the observatory at Greenwich, England, shall be 
the zero (0) meridian. Longitude shall be counted from the above 
meridian east and west up to 180 degrees, the east being positive 
and the west negative. From January 1, 1888, the time of the 
135th degree east longitude shall be the standard time of Japan." 
This is 9 h. fast. 

Imperial ordinance No. 167, of 1895: "The standard time hitherto 
used in Japan shall henceforth be called central standard time. The 
time of the 120th degree east longitude shall be the standard time 
of Formosa, the Pescadores, the Yaeyama, and the Miyako groups, 
and shall be called western standard time. This ordinance shall 
take effect from the first of January, 1896." This is 8 h. fast.

TIME USED IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES 85 

Korea, 8 h. 30 m. fast. Central standard time of Japan is telegraphed 
daily to the Imperial Japanese Post and Telegraph Office at Seoul. 
Before December, 1904, this was corrected by subtracting 30 m., 
which nearly represents the difference in longitude, and was then 
used by the railroads, street railways, and post and telegraph offices, 
and most of the better classes. Since December 1, 1904, the Jap- 
anese post-offices and railways in Korea have begun to use central 
standard time of Japan. In the country districts the people use 
sundials to some extent. 

Luxemburg, 1 h. fast, the legal and uniform time. 

Mexico, 6 h. 36 m. 26.7 s. slow. The National Astronomical Observatory 
of Tacubaya regulates a clock twice a day which marks the local 
mean time of the City of Mexico, and a signal is raised twice a week 
at noon upon the roof of the national palace, such signal being 
used to regulate the city's public clocks. This signal, the clock at 
the central telegraph office, and the public clock on the cathedral, 
serve as a basis for the time used commonly by the people. The 
general telegraph office transmits this time daily to all of its branch 
offices. Not every city in the country uses this time, however, 
since a local time, very imperfectly determined, is more commonly 
observed. The following railroad companies use standard City of 
Mexico time corrected daily by telegraph: Central, Hidalgo, Xico 
and San Rafael, National and Mexican. The Central and National 
railroads correct their clocks to City of Mexico time daily by means 
of the noon signal sent out from the Naval Observatory at Wash- 
ington (see page 71) and by a similar signal from the observatory 
at St. Louis, Missouri. The Nacozari, and the Cananea, Yaqui River 
and Pacific railroads use Mountain time, 7 h. slow, and the Sonora 
railroad uses the local time of Guaymas, 7 h. 24 m. slow. 

Nicaragua, 5 h. 45 m. 10 s. slow. Managua time is issued to all public 
offices, railways, telegraph offices and churches in a zone that 
extends from San Juan del Sur, latitude 11° 15' 44" N., to El Ocotal, 
latitude 12° 46' N., and from El Castillo, longitude 84° 22' 37" W. f 
to Corinto, longitude 87° 12' 31" W. The time of the Atlantic 
ports is usually obtained from the captains of ships. 

Norway, 1 h. fast. Central European time is used everywhere through- 
out the country. Telegraphic time signals are sent out once a 
week to the telegraph stations throughout the country from the 
observatory of the Christiania University. 

Panama. Both the local mean time of Colon, 5 h. 19 m. 39 s. slow, and 
eastern standard time of the United States, 5 h. slow, are used. The 
latter time is cabled daily by the Central and South American Cable

Company from the Naval Observatory at Washington, and will 
probably soon be adopted as standard. 

Peru, 5 h. 9 m. 3 s. slow. There is no official time. The railroad from 
Callao to Oroya takes its time by telegraph from the noon signal at 
the naval school at Callao, which may be said to be the standard 
time for Callao, Lima, and the whole of central Peru. The railroad 
from Mollendo to Lake Titicaca, in southern Peru, takes its time 
from ships in the Bay of Mollendo. 

Portugal, h. 36 m. 44.7 s. slow. Standard time is in use throughout 
Portugal and is based upon the meridian of Lisbon. It is estab- 
lished by the Royal Observatory in the Royal Park at Lisbon, 
and from there sent by telegraph to every railway station through- 
out Portugal having telegraphic communication. Clocks on railway 
station platforms are five minutes behind and clocks outside of 
stations are true. 

Russia, 2 h. 1 m. 18.6 s. fast. All telegraph stations use the time of the 
Royal Observatory at Pulkowa, near St. Petersburg. At railroad 
stations both local and Pulkowa time are given, from which it is 
to be inferred that for all local purposes local time is used. 

Salvador, 5 h. 56 m. 32 s. slow. The government has established a national 
observatory at San Salvador which issues time on Wednesdays and 
Saturdays, at noon, to all public offices, telegraph offices, railways, 
etc., throughout the Republic. 

Santo Domingo, 4 h. 39 m. 32 s. slow. Local mean time is used, but there 
is no central observatory and no means of correcting the time. The 
time differs from that of the naval vessels in these waters by about 
30 minutes. 

Servia, 1 h. fast. Central European time is used by the railroad, tele- 
graph companies, and people generally. Clocks are regulated by 
telegraph from Budapest every day at noon. 

Spain, Greenwich time. This is the official time for use in govern- 
mental offices in Spain and the Balearic Islands, railroad and 
telegraph offices. The hours are numbered from to 24, beginning 
with midnight. In some portions local time is still used for private 
matters. 

Sweden, 1 h. fast. Central European time is the standard in general 
use. It is sent out every week by telegraph from the Stockholm 
Observatory. 

Switzerland, 1 h. fast. Central European time is the only legal time. 
It is sent out daily by telegraph from the Cantonal Observatory at 
Neuchatel.

TIME USED IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES 87 

Turkey, Two kinds of time are used, Turkish and Eastern European 
time, the former for the natives and the latter for Europeans. The 
railroads generally use both, the latter for the actual running of 
trains and Turkish time-tables for the benefit of the natives. 
Standard Turkish time is used generally by the people, sunset being 
the base, and twelve hours being added for a theoretical sunrise. 
The official clocks are set daily so as to read 12 o'clock at the theo- 
retical sunrise, from tables showing the times of sunset, but the 
tower clocks are set only two or three times a week. The govern- 
ment telegraph lines use Turkish time throughout the empire, and 
St. Sophia time, 1 h. 56 m. 53 s. fast, for telegrams sent out of the 
country. 

United States. Standard time based upon the meridian of Greenwich, 
varying by whole hours from Greenwich time, is almost universally 
used, and is sent out daily by telegraph to most of the country, and 
to Havana and Panama from the Naval Observatory at Washington, 
and to the Pacific coast from the observatory at Mare Island Navy 
Yard, California. For further discussions of standard time belts in 
the United States, see pp. 66-68 and the U. S. standard time belt 
map. Insular possessions have time as follows: 
Porto Rico, 4 h. slow, Atlantic standard time. 
Alaska, 9 h. slow, Alaska standard time. 
Hawaiian Islands, 10 h. 30 m. slow, Hawaiian standard time. 
Guam, 9 h. 30 m. fast, Guam standard time. 
Philippine Islands, 8 h. fast, Philippine standard time. 
Tviuila, Samoa, 11 h. 30 m. slow, Samoan standard time. 

Uruguay, 3 h. 44 m. 48.9 s. slow. The time in common use is the mean 
time of the meridian of the dome of the Metropolitan Church of 
Montevideo. The correct time is indicated by a striking clock in 
the tower of that church. An astronomical geodetic observatory, 
with meridian telescope and chronometers, has now been estab- 
lished and will in the future furnish the time. It is proposed to 
install a time ball for the benefit of navigators at the port of Monte- 
video. An electric time service will be extended throughout the 
country, using at first the meridian of the church and afterwards 
that of the national observatory, when constructed. 

Venezuela, 4 h. 27 m. 43.6 s. The time is computed daily at the Caracas 
Observatory from observations of the sun and is occasionally tele- 
graphed to other parts of Venezuela. The cathedral clock at Caracas 
is corrected by means of these observations. Railway time is at 
least five minutes later than that indicated by the cathedral clock, 
which is accepted as standard by the people. Some people take 
time from the observatory flag, which always falls at noon.
