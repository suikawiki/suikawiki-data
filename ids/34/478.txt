The official time in use throughout Argentina is re-
ferred to the meridian of Cordoba, 4[SUP[h]] 16[SUP[m]] 48[SUP[s]].2 west
from Greenwich.  At 11 a. m. a daily signal is tele-
graphed from the Cordoba Observatory.  The great-
est deviation of local mean time from the offical
time would not exceed 26 minutes.  La Plata is
25[SUP[m]] 45[SUP[s]] east from Cordoba, and Mendoza, the most
western town of importance, is 18[SUP[m]] 32[SUP[s]] west from
Cordoba.

Peking receive this time from Chefoo; the Imperial
China Telegraphs from the office of that company
at Tientsin.  The Imperial Railways of North 
China use the same time, taking it from the British

At Bogotá the time used is that of the meridian of

the observatory, but there is no method employed
in correcting it daily by signal from acentral ob-
servatory.  Some few people, such as jewelers, go to
the observatory daily, but the great mass of business
men, railroad officials, etc., let their timepieces run
sometimes for weeks without correcting them, until
the inconveniences caused thereby compel them to
make the necessary corrections.  So far as com-
municating the time as corrected in Bogotá to other
parts of the country is concerned, this is rendered
impossible by the very poor telegraphic service, it
frequently taking 4 and 5 days to send messages a
distance of from 50 to 100 miles.
