:s: 
The official time in use throughout Argentina is re-
ferred to the meridian of Cordoba, 4[SUP[h]] 16[SUP[m]] 48[SUP[s]].2 west
from Greenwich.  At 11 a. m. a daily signal is tele-
graphed from the Cordoba Observatory.  The great-
est deviation of local mean time from the offical
time would not exceed 26 minutes.  La Plata is
25[SUP[m]] 45[SUP[s]] east from Cordoba, and Mendoza, the most
western town of importance, is 18[SUP[m]] 32[SUP[s]] west from
Cordoba.

law, but is in force by order of the proper authori-
ties.

:c: Belgium
:t: [TZ[+00:00:00]]
:s:
The official time in Belgium is calculated from 0 to 24 
hours, zero corresponding to mean midnight at 
Greenwich. The Royal Observatory at Brussels 
communicates daily the precise hour to the Central
Telegraphic  Administration and Government offices;
also to important corporations.  The Telegraphic

:s:
An observatory is maintained by the Jesuit mission at 
Zikawei near Shanghai, and a time-ball suspended 
from a mast on the French Bund in Shanghai is 
dropped electrically precisely at noon each day. This 
furnishes the local time at the port of Shanghai,
which is adopted by the railway and telegraph com-
panies represented there, as well as by the coastwise 
shipping. From Shanghai the time is telegraphed 
to other ports.  The cable companies represented in
Peking receive this time from Chefoo; the Imperial
China Telegraphs from the office of that company
at Tientsin.  The Imperial Railways of North 
China use the same time, taking it from the British 
gun at Tientsin and passing it on to the stations of 
the railway twice each day, at 8 a. m. and at 8 p. m. 
No information yet from the Peking-Hankau Railway.

At Bogotá the time used is that of the meridian of
Bogotá.  This time is taken every day at noon in 
the observatory, but there is no method employed
in correcting it daily by signal from acentral ob-
servatory.  Some few people, such as jewelers, go to
the observatory daily, but the great mass of business
men, railroad officials, etc., let their timepieces run
sometimes for weeks without correcting them, until
the inconveniences caused thereby compel them to
make the necessary corrections.  So far as com-
municating the time as corrected in Bogotá to other
parts of the country is concerned, this is rendered
impossible by the very poor telegraphic service, it
frequently taking 4 and 5 days to send messages a
distance of from 50 to 100 miles. 

:c: Costa Rica
:t: [TZ[-05:36:16.9]]
:s:
The Government has established an observatory at
the capital, San José, in latitude 9° 56′ north, longi-
tude 84° 4′ 14″ west from Greenwich; altitude 3.800
feed above see level.  The Greenwich meridian is
used exclusively to regulate observatory time, which
is corrected by observation and reduced to mean
time.  This time is issued to public offices, railway
and telegraph offices, churches, and to all residents
whose occupations necessitate correct time. There
is no method employed to correct time by signal
from the observatory, the corrected time being taken
by applicants from the standard chronometer at the
observatory.

Mean solar time of the meridian 15° east

post and telegraph offices, and Italian coasting 
steamers, are to use this time and regulate their

:s:
Tokyo time, 135° east from Greenwich, is telegraphed
daily to the Imperial Japanese Post and Telegraph 
Office at Seoul.  Before December 1, 1904, this was 
corrected by subtracting 30 minutes, which nearly 
represents the difference in longitude, and was then 
used by the railroads, street railways, and post and 
telegraph offices, and most of the better classes. 
Since December 1, 1904, the Japanese post-offices 
and railways in Korea have begun to use Tokyo
time.  In the country districts the people use sun
dials to some extent.

The National Astronomical Observatory of Tacubaya 
regulates a clock twice a day which marks the 
local mean time of the City of Mexico, 6[SUP[h]] 36[SUP[m]] 26[SUP[s]].7
west from Greenwich, and a signal is raised twice 
a week at noon upon the roof of the national palace, 
such signal being used to regulate the city's public 
clocks.  This signal, the clock at the central tele-
graph office, and the public clock on the cathedral, 
serve as a basis for the time used commonly by the 
people.  The general telegraph office transmits this 
time daily to all of its branch offices.  Not every 
city in the country uses this time, however, since a 
local time, very imperfectly determined, is more 
commonly observed.
The following railroad companies use standard City of 
Mexico time corrected daily by telegraph: Cen-
tral, Hidalgo, Xico and San Rafael, National and 
Mexican.  The Central and National railroads 
correct their clocks to City of Mexico time daily 
by means of the noon signal sent out from the 
Naval Observatory at Washington, and by a similar 
signal from the observatory at St. Louis, Mo.

All telegraph stations use the time of Pulkowa (St.
Petersburg).  At railroad stations both local and 
Pulkowa time are given, from which it is to be in-
ferred that for all local purposes local time is used.

Official time is the mean time of the meridian of 
Greenwich, obtained from the Madrid Observatory.
It is used by railroad and telegraph companies
and the people of Madrid and provinces generally,
in some of which, however, local time is still used
for private matters.

:s:
Two kinds of time are used, i. e., Turkish and east-
ern European time, the former for the natives and 
the latter for Europeans.  The railroads generally 
use both, the latter for the actual running of trains 
and Turkish time-tables for the benefit of the na-
tives.  Standard Turkish time is used generally by 
the people, sunset being the base and twelve hours be-
ing added for a theoretical sunrise.  The official 
clocks are set daily so as to read 12 o'clock at the
theoretical sunrise, but the tower clocks are set only 
two or three times a week.  The government tele-
graph lines use Turkish time throughout the Em-
pire and St. Sophia time, 1[SUP[h]] 47[SUP[m]] 32[SUP[s]] ahead of Paris,
for telegrams sent out of the country.

Standard time based upon the meridian of Greenwich is 
universally used and is sent out daily by telegraph 
to most of the country and to Habana and Panama 
from the Naval Observatory at Washington; and 
to the Pacific coast, from the observatory at Mare 
Island Navy-Yard, California.  Standard times used
are as follows:

:s:
The time in common use for railways, telegraph com-
panies, and the public in general, is the mean time of the 
meridian of the dome of the Metropolitan Church of 
Montevideo.  The correct time is indicated by a strik-
ing clock in the tower of that church.  An astro-
nomical geodetic observatory, with meridian tele-
scope and chronometers, has now been established 
and will in the future furnish the time   It is pro-
posed to install a time-ball for the benefit of naviga-
tors at the port of Montevideo.  An electric time 
service will be extended throughout the country, 
using at first the meridian of the church and after-
wards that of the national observatory, when con-
structed.

:a: C. T.
:s:
The time is computed daily at the Caracas Observa-
tory, longitude 66° 55′ 53.6″ west from Greenwich,
from observations of the sun and is occasionally tele- 
graphed to other parts of Venezuela.  The cathe-
dral clock at Caracas is corrected by means of these 
observations.  Railway time is at least 5 minutes 
later than that indicated by the cathedral clock, 
which is accepted as standard by the entire people. 
Some people take time from the observatory flag, 
which always falls at noon.
