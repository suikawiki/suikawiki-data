The official time in use throughout Argentina is re-
ferred to the meridian of Cordoba, 4[SUP[h]] 16[SUP[m]] 48[SUP[s]].2 west
from Greenwich.  At 11 a. m. a daily signal is tele-
graphed from the Cordoba Observatory.  The great-
est deviation of local mean time from the offical
time would not exceed 26 minutes.  La Plata is
25[SUP[m]] 45[SUP[s]] east from Cordoba, and Mendoza, the most
western town of importance, is 18[SUP[m]] 32[SUP[s]] west from
Cordoba.

:s:
An observatory is maintained by the Jesuit mission at 
Zikawei near Shanghai, and a time-ball suspended 
from a mast on the French Bund in Shanghai is 
dropped electrically precisely at noon each day. This 
furnishes the local time at the port of Shanghai,
which is adopted by the railway and telegraph com-
panies represented there, as well as by the coastwise 
shipping. From Shanghai the time is telegraphed 
to other ports.  The cable companies represented in
Peking receive this time from Chefoo; the Imperial
China Telegraphs from the office of that company
at Tientsin.  The Imperial Railways of North 
China use the same time, taking it from the British 
gun at Tientsin and passing it on to the stations of 
the railway twice each day, at 8 a. m. and at 8 p. m.

At Bogotá the time used is that of the meridian of
Bogotá.  This time is taken every day at noon in 
the observatory, but there is no method employed
in correcting it daily by signal from acentral ob-
servatory.  Some few people, such as jewelers, go to
the observatory daily, but the great mass of business
men, railroad officials, etc., let their timepieces run
sometimes for weeks without correcting them, until
the inconveniences caused thereby compel them to
make the necessary corrections.  So far as com-
municating the time as corrected in Bogotá to other
parts of the country is concerned, this is rendered
impossible by the very poor telegraphic service, it
frequently taking 4 and 5 days to send messages a
distance of from 50 to 100 miles.

The Government has established an observatory at
the capital, San José, in latitude 9° 56′ north, longi-
tude 84° 4′ 14″ west from Greenwich; altitude 3.800
feed above see level.  The Greenwich meridian is
used exclusively to regulate observatory time, which
is corrected by observation and reduced to mean
time.  This time is issued to public offices, railway
and telegraph offices, churches, and to all residents
whose occupations necessitate correct time. There
is no method employed to correct time by signal
from the observatory, the corrected time being taken
by applicants from the standard chronometer at the
observatory.

[I[Italy]], 1 h. fast. Adopted by royal decree of August 10, 1893. This 
time is kept in all government establishments, ships of the Italian 
Navy in the ports of Italy, railroads, telegraph offices, and Italian 
coasting steamers. The hours are numbered from 0 to 24, 
beginning with midnight. 

[I[Japan]]. Imperial ordinance No. 51, of 1886: “The meridian that 
passes through the observatory at Greenwich, England, shall be 
the zero (0) meridian. Longitude shall be counted from the above 
meridian east and west up to 180 degrees, the east being positive 
and the west negative. From January 1, 1888, the time of the 
135th degree east longitude shall be the standard time of Japan.”
This is 9 h. fast. 

Imperial ordinance No. 167, of 1895: “The standard time hitherto 
used in Japan shall henceforth be called central standard time. The 
time of the 120th degree east longitude shall be the standard time 
of Formosa, the Pescadores, the Yaeyama, and the Miyako groups, 
and shall be called western standard time. This ordinance shall 
take effect from the first of January, 1896.” This is 8 h. fast. 

[I[Korea]], 8 h. 30 m. fast. Central standard time of Japan is telegraphed 
daily to the Imperial Japanese Post and Telegraph Office at Seoul. 
Before December, 1904, this was corrected by subtracting 30 m., 
which nearly represents the difference in longitude, and was then 
used by the railroads, street railways, and post and telegraph offices, 
and most of the better classes. Since December 1, 1904, the Jap- 
anese post-offices and railways in Korea have begun to use central 
standard time of Japan. In the country districts the people use 
sundials to some extent. 

[I[Luxemburg]], 1 h. fast, the legal and uniform time. 

[I[Mexico]], 6 h. 36 m. 26.7 s. slow. The National Astronomical Observatory 
of Tacubaya regulates a clock twice a day which marks the local 
mean time of the City of Mexico, and a signal is raised twice a week 
at noon upon the roof of the national palace, such signal being 
used to regulate the city's public clocks. This signal, the clock at 
the central telegraph office, and the public clock on the cathedral, 
serve as a basis for the time used commonly by the people. The 
general telegraph office transmits this time daily to all of its branch 
offices. Not every city in the country uses this time, however, 
since a local time, very imperfectly determined, is more commonly 
observed. The following railroad companies use standard City of 
Mexico time corrected daily by telegraph: Central, Hidalgo, Xico 
and San Rafael, National and Mexican. The Central and National 
railroads correct their clocks to City of Mexico time daily by means 
of the noon signal sent out from the Naval Observatory at Wash- 
ington (see page 71) and by a similar signal from the observatory 
at St. Louis, Missouri. The Nacozari, and the Cananea, Yaqui River 
and Pacific railroads use Mountain time, 7 h. slow, and the Sonora 
railroad uses the local time of Guaymas, 7 h. 24 m. slow. 

[I[Nicaragua]], 5 h. 45 m. 10 s. slow. Managua time is issued to all public 
offices, railways, telegraph offices and churches in a zone that 
extends from San Juan del Sur, latitude 11° 15' 44" N., to El Ocotal, 
latitude 12° 46' N., and from El Castillo, longitude 84° 22' 37" W., 
to Corinto, longitude 87° 12' 31" W. The time of the Atlantic 
ports is usually obtained from the captains of ships. 

[I[Norway]], 1 h. fast. Central European time is used everywhere through- 
out the country. Telegraphic time signals are sent out once a 
week to the telegraph stations throughout the country from the 
observatory of the Christiania University. 

[I[Panama]]. Both the local mean time of Colon, 5 h. 19 m. 39 s. slow, and 
eastern standard time of the United States, 5 h. slow, are used. The 
latter time is cabled daily by the Central and South American Cable 
Company from the Naval Observatory at Washington, and will 
probably soon be adopted as standard. 

[I[Peru]], 5 h. 9 m. 3 s. slow. There is no official time. The railroad from 
Callao to Oroya takes its time by telegraph from the noon signal at 
the naval school at Callao, which may be said to be the standard 
time for Callao, Lima, and the whole of central Peru. The railroad 
from Mollendo to Lake Titicaca, in southern Peru, takes its time 
from ships in the Bay of Mollendo. 

[I[Portugal]], 0 h. 36 m. 44.7 s. slow. Standard time is in use throughout 
Portugal and is based upon the meridian of Lisbon. It is estab- 
lished by the Royal Observatory in the Royal Park at Lisbon, 
and from there sent by telegraph to every railway station through- 
out Portugal having telegraphic communication. Clocks on railway 
station platforms are five minutes behind and clocks outside of 
stations are true. 

[I[Russia]], 2 h. 1 m. 18.6 s. fast. All telegraph stations use the time of the 
Royal Observatory at Pulkowa, near St. Petersburg. At railroad 
stations both local and Pulkowa time are given, from which it is 
to be inferred that for all local purposes local time is used. 

[I[Salvador]], 5 h. 56 m. 32 s. slow. The government has established a national 
observatory at San Salvador which issues time on Wednesdays and 
Saturdays, at noon, to all public offices, telegraph offices, railways, 
etc., throughout the Republic. 

[I[Santo Domingo]], 4 h. 39 m. 32 s. slow. Local mean time is used, but there 
is no central observatory and no means of correcting the time. The 
time differs from that of the naval vessels in these waters by about 
30 minutes. 

[I[Servia]], 1 h. fast. Central European time is used by the railroad, tele- 
graph companies, and people generally. Clocks are regulated by 
telegraph from Budapest every day at noon. 

[I[Spain]], Greenwich time. This is the official time for use in govern- 
mental offices in Spain and the Balearic Islands, railroad and 
telegraph offices. The hours are numbered from 0 to 24, beginning 
with midnight. In some portions local time is still used for private 
matters. 

[I[Sweden]], 1 h. fast. Central European time is the standard in general 
use. It is sent out every week by telegraph from the Stockholm 
Observatory. 

[I[Switzerland]], 1 h. fast. Central European time is the only legal time. 
It is sent out daily by telegraph from the Cantonal Observatory at 
Neuchatel. 

[I[Turkey]], Two kinds of time are used, Turkish and Eastern European 
time, the former for the natives and the latter for Europeans. The 
railroads generally use both, the latter for the actual running of 
trains and Turkish time-tables for the benefit of the natives. 
Standard Turkish time is used generally by the people, sunset being 
the base, and twelve hours being added for a theoretical sunrise. 
The official clocks are set daily so as to read 12 o'clock at the theo- 
retical sunrise, from tables showing the times of sunset, but the 
tower clocks are set only two or three times a week. The govern- 
ment telegraph lines use Turkish time throughout the empire, and 
St. Sophia time, 1 h. 56 m. 53 s. fast, for telegrams sent out of the 
country. 

[I[United States]]. Standard time based upon the meridian of Greenwich, 
varying by whole hours from Greenwich time, is almost universally 
used, and is sent out daily by telegraph to most of the country, and 
to Havana and Panama from the Naval Observatory at Washington, 
and to the Pacific coast from the observatory at Mare Island Navy 
Yard, California. For further discussions of standard time belts in 
the United States, see pp. 66―68 and the U. S. standard time belt 
map. Insular possessions have time as follows: 

[BOX(indent)[

[I[Porto Rico]], 4 h. slow, Atlantic standard time. 

[I[Alaska]], 9 h. slow, Alaska standard time. 

[I[Hawaiian Islands]], 10 h. 30 m. slow, Hawaiian standard time. 

[I[Guam]], 9 h. 30 m. fast, Guam standard time. 

[I[Philippine Islands]], 8 h. fast, Philippine standard time. 

[I[Tutuila]], [I[Samoa]], 11 h. 30 m. slow, Samoan standard time.

[I[Uruguay]], 3 h. 44 m. 48.9 s. slow. The time in common use is the mean 
time of the meridian of the dome of the Metropolitan Church of 
Montevideo. The correct time is indicated by a striking clock in 
the tower of that church. An astronomical geodetic observatory, 
with meridian telescope and chronometers, has now been estab- 
lished and will in the future furnish the time. It is proposed to 
install a time ball for the benefit of navigators at the port of Monte- 
video. An electric time service will be extended throughout the 
country, using at first the meridian of the church and afterwards 
that of the national observatory, when constructed. 

[I[Venezuela]], 4 h. 27 m. 43.6 s. The time is computed daily at the Caracas 
Observatory from observations of the sun and is occasionally tele- 
graphed to other parts of Venezuela. The cathedral clock at Caracas 
is corrected by means of these observations. Railway time is at 
least five minutes later than that indicated by the cathedral clock, 
which is accepted as standard by the people. Some people take 
time from the observatory flag, which always falls at noon.
