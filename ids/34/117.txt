> Inspired by GitHub Flavored Markdown which is an extension of ordinary Markdown by things belonging specifically to GitHub (like referencing commits, users, etc.) we have created Gerby Flavored Markdown, or GFM.
> As discussed before you can use LaTeX-style mathematics the way you are used to.
> You can refer to tags by using \ref{tag}. So \ref{0001} will automatically be converted to 0001.
