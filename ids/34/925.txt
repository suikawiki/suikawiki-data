> JSMD, short for JavaScript MarkDown, is the file format that Iodide notebooks are written in. It provides a way to interleave the narrative parts of your notebook, written in Markdown, with the computational parts, written in JavaScript, or through the use of language plugins, in other languages such as Python or OCaml.
