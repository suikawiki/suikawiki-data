*Abstract

Biology-Inspired techniques for Self-Organization in dynamic
Networks (BISON) is a three-year Shared-Cost RTD Project
(IST-2001-38923) funded by the Future and Emerging Tech-
nologies initiative of the Information Society Technologies
Programme of the European Commission. It runs from Jan-
uary 2003 until December 2005.1 The objective of BISON
is the design and implementation of algorithms for manage-
ment and control in modern network environments. These
environments are typically large, complex, highly dynamic,
and heterogeneous. To cope with these challenges, network
algorithms should have fully distributed and self-organizing
architectures, and be adaptive, robust, and scalable. The
central claim of BISON is that the observation and analysis
of complex adaptive systems found in Nature can be a major
source of inspiration to design algorithms with such charac-
teristics. In what follows, we rst describe the objectives of
the project. Then we present the specic classes of networks
that have been investigated, and discuss some of the results
obtained so far in conjunction with the biological mecha-
nisms that have provided useful design guidelines. More de-
tails can be found at http://www.cs.unibo.it/bison.
