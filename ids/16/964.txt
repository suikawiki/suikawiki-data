*SUMMARY

In this paper, we describe AntHocNet, an algorithm for routing in mobile ad hoc networks. It is a hybrid
algorithm, which combines reactive path setup with proactive path probing, maintenance and improvement.
The algorithm is based on the nature-inspired ant colony optimisation framework. Paths are learned by
guided Monte Carlo sampling using ant-like agents communicating in a stigmergic way. In an extensive set
of simulation experiments, we compare AntHocNet with AODV, a reference algorithm in the field. We
show that our algorithm can outperform AODV on different evaluation criteria. AntHocNet’s performance
advantage is visible over a broad range of possible network scenarios, and increases for larger, sparser and
more mobile networks. Copyright # 2005 AEIT.
