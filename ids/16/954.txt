*Abstract

Although an ant is a simple creature, collectively a
colony of ants performs useful tasks such as finding the shortest
path to a food source and sharing this information with other ants
by depositing pheromone. In the field of ant colony optimization
(ACO), models of collective intelligence of ants are transformed into
useful optimization techniques that find applications in computer
networking. In this survey, the problem-solving paradigm of ACO
is explicated and compared to traditional routing algorithms along
the issues of routing information, routing overhead and adaptivity.
The contributions of this survey include 1) providing a comparison
and critique of the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating stagnation
(a major problem in many ACO algorithms), 2) surveying
and comparing three major research in applying ACO in routing
and load-balancing, and 3) discussing new directions and identifying
open problems. The approaches for mitigating stagnation discussed
include: evaporation, aging, pheromone smoothing and limiting,
privileged pheromone laying and pheromone-heuristic control.
The survey onACOin routing/load-balancing includes comparison
and critique of ant-based control and its ramifications, AntNet and
its extensions, as well as ASGA and SynthECA. Discussions on new
directions include an ongoing work of the authors in applying multiple
ant colony optimization in load-balancing.
Index Terms―Ant colony optimization, collective intelligence,
mobile agent, swarm intelligence.
