*Abstract
Sensor Networks is a very important research area. Small sensor nodes
are scattered around the sensor eld to detect interested events. Forest
re is considered as destructive events in which early warning system
can be accomplished by a sensor system. In event detection, events is
detected by ooding of interest and a set of broadcast communications.
These approaches consume more energy. In this paper, we propose
a classical ant colony algorithm with event ooding applied to event
detection in sensor networks. The proposed algorithm was evaluated
using ns2 simulator. The performance results show that the proposed
scheme has consumed less energy compared with previously proposed
algorithm in forest re detection environment. Event ooding around
the event source reduces average nding time.
