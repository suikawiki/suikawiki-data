> JBST is an MVC-style client-side Ajax templating solution which syntactically feels like JavaServer Pages / ASP.NET UserControls. It uses JsonML as the encoding and pure JavaScript as the template language.
> Once JBST is compiled to JsonML+JavaScript, it may be combined and compressed with all other JavaScript to produce a lightweight templating system with true separation of data and layout.

> DUEL is the next generation of JBST (JsonML + Browser-Side Template). Templates are written in an improved syntax which can be executed in JavaScript as a client-side template or in Java as a server-side template.
