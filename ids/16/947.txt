*1 Introduction

Traditional sensing models assume one or a few powerful
sensors and centralized computation. Today, technological
trends enable the creation of inexpensive, small, intelligent
devices for sensing and actuation. If many small sensors
can work together as a sensor network, they provide several
advantages over traditional centralized sensing. By placing
the sensor close to the object being sensed, signal processing
and target discrimination problems in sensing can be
greatly simplified. By communicating over several short
hops rather than one long hop, energy consumed in communication
can be reduced [29]. Moreover, by processing
data in the network, often the amount of data transfered can
be reduced, further saving energy [22].

Motivated by robustness, scaling, and energy efficiency
requirements, this paper examines a new data dissemination
paradigm for such sensor networks. This paradigm,
which we call directed diffusion1, is data-centric. Data generated
by sensor nodes is named by attribute-value pairs.
A node requests data by sending interests for named data.
Data matching the interest is then “drawn” down towards
that node. Intermediate nodes can cache, or transform data,
and may direct interests based on previously cached data
(Section 3).

Directed diffusion is significantly different from IP-style
communication where nodes are identified by their endpoints,
and inter-node communication is layered on an end-
to-end delivery service provided within the network. In directed
diffusion, nodes in the network are application-aware
as we allow application-specific code to run in the network
and assist diffusion in processing messages. This allows directed
diffusion to cache and process data in the network
(aggregation), decreasing the amount of end-to-end traffic,
and resulting in higher energy savings. We show that using
directed diffusion one can realize robust multi-path delivery,
empirically adapt to a small subset of network paths,
and achieve significant energy savings when intermediate
nodes aggregate responses to queries (Section 5).

This chapter describes diffusion, starting from the point
of view of an application (Section 2) and naming (Section
2.2). We realize these abstractions with lower-level
primitives and several different data dissemination algorithms
described in Section 3, and show how applications
can influence routing (Section 4). We summarize simulation
and experimentation results in Section 5.

1Van Jacobson suggested the concept of “diffusing” attribute named
data for this class of applications that later led to the design of directed
diffusion.
