*ABSTRACT

This paper describes how the Ant
System can be improved by selfadaptation
of its controlling parameters.
Adaptation is achieved by integrating a
genetic algorithm with the ant system
and maintaining a population of agents
(ants) that have been used to generate
solutions. These agents have behavior
that is inspired by the foraging activities
of ants, with each agent capable of
simple actions. Problem solving is
inherently distributed and arises as a
consequence of the self-organization of a
collection of agents, or swarm system.
This paper applies the Ant System with
Genetic Algorithm (ASGA) system to
the problem of path finding in
networks, demonstrating by
experimentation that the hybrid
algorithm exhibits improved
performance when compared to the
basic Ant System.

The migration decision
function is given by:

pk(i,j) = [T(i,j)]a k[C(i,j,u)]-β_k / Nk (1)
{{category 選択:heuristic}}
{{category 選択:α乗β乗}}

Nk = Σ_(j in Sk (i)) [T(i,j)]ak[C(i,j,u)] -β_k
{{category 蓄積型}}

Where:
&#183; i and j are vertex indices,
&#183; u(i,j) is the utilization of the link between i and j,
&#183; T(i,j) is the quantity of pheromone present on the link
between the ith and jth nodes,
&#183; C(i,j,u) is the cost associated with the link between the
ith and jth nodes with utilization u(i,j),
&#183; Sk (i) is set of nodes not yet visited for the kth agent
that can be reached from the ith node,
&#183; pk(i,j) is the probability that the kth agent will choose
the edge from the ith to the jth node as its next hop,
&#183; ak is the sensitivity to pheromone for the kth agent,
&#183; bk is the sensitivity to the cost of the network link for
the kth agent.
To re-iterate, the values ak and bk are encoded
genetically in the agent's description.
Once all agents have been routed for a given iteration the
ReinforcePathFollowedByAgent function is used to update
the T(i,j) values based upon the routes found by the agents.
The update rule is given by:

T(i,j) ← T(i,j) + Σ_k ΔT_k(i,j) (2)

Where:

ΔT_k (i, j) = f(Cost_k) if (i, j) in R_k, 0 otherwise
{{category 増加:重み付き}}

&#183; Rk is the path found for agent k,
&#183; Costk is the cost of path found for agent k,
&#183; f(Costk) is the function used to update pheromone
concentrations on the edges in the path computed by
agent k.
