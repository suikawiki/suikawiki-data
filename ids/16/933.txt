* ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a novel routing scheme for mobile ad
hoc networks (MANETs), which combines the on-demand
routing capability of Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector
(AODV) routing protocol with a distributed topology
discovery mechanism using ant like mobile agents. AODV
requires the actual communication to be delayed until the
route is determined (found). This may not be suitable for real
time data and multimedia communication applications. Ant-AODV provides high connectivity, reducing the amount of
route discoveries before starting new connections. This
eliminates the delay before starting actual communication for
most new connections making Ant-AODV routing protocol
ideal for real time communication in highly dynamic
networks such as MANETs. Simulation results show that the
Ant-AODV hybrid technique proposed in this paper is able to
achieve reduced end-to-end delay as compared to
conventional ant-based and AODV routing protocols. In
addition, Ant-AODV also provides high connectivity.
