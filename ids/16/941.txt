*Abstract
In this paper, we present a family of adaptive protocols,
called SPIN (Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation),
that efficiently disseminates information among sensors
in an energy-constrained wireless sensor network. Nodes
running a SPIN communication protocol name their data using
high-level data descriptors, called meta-data. They use
meta-data negotiations to eliminate the transmission of redundant
data throughout the network. In addition, SPIN
nodes can base their communication decisions both upon
application-specific knowledge of the data and upon knowledge
of the resources that are available to them. This allows
the sensors to efficiently distribute data given a limited energy
supply. We simulate and analyze the performance of
two specific SPIN protocols, comparing them to other possible
approaches and a theoretically optimal protocol. We
find that the SPIN protocols can deliver 60% more data for a
given amount of energy than conventional approaches. We
also find that, in terms of dissemination rate and energy
usage, the SPlN protocols perform close to the theoretical
optimum.
