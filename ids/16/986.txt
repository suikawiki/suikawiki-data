*Abstract
Due to the wide deployment of sensor networks recently
security in sensor networks has become a hot research
topic. Popular ways to secure a sensor network are by
including cryptographic techniques or by safeguarding
sensitive information from unauthorized
access/manipulation and by implementing efficient
intrusion detection mechanisms. This paper proposes a
novel ant colony based intrusion detection mechanism
which could also keep track of the intruder trials. The
IDEAS technique could work in conjunction with the
conventional machine learning based intrusion detection
techniques to secure the sensor networks. The algorithm
is presented and illustrated by simulating a sensor
network.
