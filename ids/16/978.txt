*ABSTRACT

Advances in processor, memory and radio technology will
enable small arid cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication
and computation. Networks of such nodes can coordinate
to perform distributed sensing of environmental phenomena.
In this paper, we explore the directed diffusion
paradigm for such coordination. Directed diffusion is datacentric
in that all communication is for named data. All
nodes in a directed diffusion-based network are applicationaware.
This enables diffusion to achieve energy savings by
selecting empirically good paths and by caching and processing
data in-network. We explore and evaluate the use
of directed diffusion for a simple remote-surveillance sensor
network.

* Ant Routing への言及

Diffusion is clearly related to traditional network data routing
algorithms. In some sense, it is a reactive routing technique,
since "routes" are established on demand. However,
it differs from other ad-hoc reactive routing techniques in
several ways. First, no attempt is made to find one loopfree
path between source and sink before data transmission
commences. Instead, constrained or directional flooding is
used to set up a multiplicity of paths, and data messages
are initially sent redundantly along these paths. Second,
soon thereafter, reinforcement attempts to reduce this multiplicity
of paths to a small number, based on empirically
observed path performance. Finally, a message cache is used
to perform loop avoidance. The interest and gradient setup
mechanisms themselves do not guarantee loop-free paths between
source and sink.

Why this peculiar choice of design? At the outset of this
research, we consciously chose to explore path setup algorithms
that establish network paths using strictly local
(neighbor-to-neighbor) communication. The intuition behind
this choice is the observation that physical systems
(e.g., ant colonies [5]) that build up transmission paths using
such communication scale well and are extraordinarily
robust. However, using strictly local communication implies
that path setup cannot use global topology metrics;
local communication implies that, as far as a node knows,
the data that it received from a neighbor came from that
neighbor 9. This can be energy efficient in highly dynamic
networks when changes in topology need not be propagated
across the network. Of course, the resulting communication
paths may be sub-optimal. However, the energy inefficiency
due to path sub-optimality can be countered by carefully
designed in-network aggregation techniques. Overall, we believe
that this approach trades off some energy efficiency for
increased robustness and scale.
