*Abstract

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a collection of mobile
nodes which communicate over radio. These kind of
networks are very flexible, thus they do not require any existing
infrastructure or central administration. Therefore, mobile
ad-hoc networks are suitable for temporary communication
links. The biggest challenge in this kind of networks
is to find a path between the communication end points,
what is aggravated through the node mobility.

In this paper we present a new on-demand routing algorithm
for mobile, multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The protocol
is based on swarm intelligence and especially on the
ant colony based meta heuristic. These approaches try to
map the solution capability of swarms to mathematical and
engineering problems. The introduced routing protocol is
highly adaptive, efficient and scalable. The main goal in
the design of the protocol was to reduce the overhead for
routing. We refer to the protocol as the Ant-Colony-Based
Routing Algorithm (ARA).
