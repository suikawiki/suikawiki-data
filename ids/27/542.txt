>       Bytes stored within a computer do not have a "bit order", since
>       they are always treated as a unit.  However, a byte considered as
>       an integer between 0 and 255 does have a most- and least-
>       significant bit, and since we write numbers with the most-
>       significant digit on the left, we also write bytes with the most-
>       significant bit on the left.  In the diagrams below, we number the
>       bits of a byte so that bit 0 is the least-significant bit, i.e.,
>       the bits are numbered:
>          +--------+
>          |76543210|
>          +--------+
