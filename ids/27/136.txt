> I would encourage you to re-think the Issuer+SerialNumber being the only blocking mechanism. Both CRLSets and Microsoft's Certificate Distrust Lists have found that in the real world of revocations (most notably, DigiNotar), issuer+serial number is NOT sufficient. There are times where you want Subject+Public Key, as a given Subject+PublicKey may have many issuers, some of which the affected CA does not disclose.
