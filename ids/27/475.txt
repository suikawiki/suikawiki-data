> The kramdown syntax is based on the Markdown syntax and has been enhanced with features that are found in other Markdown implementations like Maruku, PHP Markdown Extra and Pandoc. However, it strives to provide a strict syntax with definite rules and therefore isn’t completely compatible with Markdown. Nonetheless, most Markdown documents should work fine when parsed with kramdown.
