> Chromium watches for an HTTP header of the form "X-DNS-Prefetch-Control" (case insensitive) with a value of either "on" or "off." Â This setting changes the default behavior for the rendered content. A "meta http-equiv" tag of the same name can be used to make policy changes within a page. If a page explicitly opts out of DNS prefetch, further attempts to opt in are ignored.
