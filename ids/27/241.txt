>          Pathname is defined to be the character string which must be
>          input to a file system by a user in order to identify a file.
>          Pathname normally contains device and/or directory names, and
>          file name specification.  FTP does not yet specify a standard
>          pathname convention.  Each user must follow the file naming
>          conventions of the file systems involved in the transfer.
