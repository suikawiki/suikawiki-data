> While not strictly a regnal year, time in the United States of America can be derived from the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776). For example, the U.S. Constitution is dated as signed in "the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth," and Presidential proclamations will often be ended "IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this '''['''ordinal''']''' day of '''['''month''']''', in the year of our Lord '''['''year''']''', and of the Independence of the United States of America the '''['''year''']'''." 2016 is the 241st year of the Independence of the United States of America. Time is also sometimes reckoned in terms (and sessions, if necessary) of Congress; e.g. House of Representatives Bill 2 of the 112th Congress is dated "112th CONGRESS, 1st Session".'''['''1''']'''

> Given at Seattle, in the State of Washington, this twelfth day of June, two thousand and nine and of the University the one hundred and forty-ninth.
> '''['''signatures and seals''']'''
> See that last sentence?  It contains an ungrammatical coordination: this twelfth day of June, two thousand and nine and of the University the one hundred and forty-ninth.  That sentence makes it sound as if this is the twelfth of June 2009 and also the twelfth of the University the one hundred and forty-ninth, whatever that might mean.  I'm pretty certain I can guess how this happened.  Something's missing—can you see what it is?  I'll bet that sentence used to read:
> Given at Seattle, in the State of Washington, this twelfth day of June, the Year of Our Lord two thousand and nine and of the University the one hundred and forty-ninth.
> ...then somebody noticed it's inappropriate to have a religious reference in a diploma from a state school, and they solved the problem by deleting it.  Heck of a job.  Nicely done.
> '''['''Update: The Wife pointed out that I also have an MA from the same institution and suggested I check if it has the same error.  It doesn't!  The corresponding line reads: "Given at Seattle, in the State of Washington, this seventeenth Day of December, Two Thousand and Four, in the One Hundred and forty-fourth Year of the University."  They've successfully avoided the error by recasting the sentence.
