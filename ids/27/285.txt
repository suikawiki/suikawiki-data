>     Locations while uninhabited now use '-00', not 'zzz', as a
placeholder time zone abbreviation.  This is inspired by Internet
RFC 3339 and is more consistent with numeric time zone
abbreviations already used elsewhere.  The change affects several
arctic and antarctic locations, e.g., America/Cambridge_Bay before
1920 and Antarctica/Troll before 2005.
