> WebExtensions are a new way to write browser extensions.
> The technology is designed for cross-browser compatibility: to a large extent the API is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with multiprocess Firefox.
> We intend to deprecate XUL and XPCOM-based add-ons, and encourage add-on developers to use the WebExtensions API for new development.
