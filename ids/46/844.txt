>4. Representation of the "de facto" (not existed in Unicode *) Capital/Title case "Mkhedruli Mtavruli" instead of practically unused anient "Asomtavruli" **
>* Unocode standard for Georgian now is not up to date comparing to new trends in Georgian mass media and the web - sharply influenced by Western media
>** Example of extensive usage of Geogian "Mkhedruli Capitals" in the range of Unicode old "Asomtavruli" is the web site of the Parliament of Georgia where Georgian "Capitals" are used same as in English and other Latin based scriptures.

>* Georgian fonts "hijacked" the Asomtavruli code points since that
script isn't used anymore (due to the lack of the feature mentioned
above). They even used code points that aren't defined by Unicode.
>* Not following the standards is *really* bad. Using undefined code
points is even worse, because those can lead to rendering problems.
>So now we are between two walls: as a Unicode font we can't afford to
put Mtavruli in the area of Asomtavruli, since the latter may be added
in a distant future, and then we would really have a problem.
>On the other hand, we cannot deny the current usage. I could evangelize
a lot here about how bad it is, it doesn't take away the fact that
numerous text documents already use the Asomtavruli code points for
Mtavruli.
>In short: Unicode has a serious problem here, because a variant of the
standard is in use now, and I really doubt Unicode will change that
standard, unless some serious work is done by Georgian people for that
to happen, with a *lot* of good arguments why to change the code points
(mentioning current usage is different from the standard would be a
good argument, I'd think, but it's going to need a lot more than
that)... I'd like to get the opinion of other people that know about
the issue first as well before taking a decision on what to do with
Mtavruli.

2. On Georgian Parliament web site they are using "BPG Glaho" where Mkhedruli Mtavruli is inside range of AsoMtavruli (and are using Dynamic, Web Font for MS Internet Eplorer) -- here is font whuch can solve this problem for you.
> 
Actually - De-Facto standard in Georgia is Mkhedruli Mtavruli in the range of AsoMtavruli of Unicode - this is a case when practice9 practical necessity commands...
