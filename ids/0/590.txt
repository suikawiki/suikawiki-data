* MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text [INS[MIME (多目的 Internet メイル拡張) 第3部: 非 ASCII 文用メッセージ頭拡張]]


** Status of this Memo [INS[このメモの位置付け]]

> This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.


** Abstract [INS[概要]]

> STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying
considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the
message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of
documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

= (1) textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,
= (2) an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message
bodies,
= (3) multi-part message bodies, and
= (4) textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.

> These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD
11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said
so little about message bodies, these documents are largely
orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.

> This particular document is the third document in the series.  It
describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in
Internet mail header fields.

> Other documents in this series include:

[PRE[
   + RFC 2045, which specifies the various headers used to describe
     the structure of MIME messages.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   + RFC 2046, which defines the general structure of the MIME media
     typing system and defines an initial set of media types,
]PRE]

[PRE[
   + RFC 2048, which specifies various IANA registration procedures
     for MIME-related facilities, and
]PRE]

[PRE[
   + RFC 2049, which describes MIME conformance criteria and
     provides some illustrative examples of MIME message formats,
     acknowledgements, and the bibliography.
]PRE]

> These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which
themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC
2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.


** 1. Introduction [INS[はじめに]]

[PRE[
   RFC 2045 describes a mechanism for denoting textual body parts which
   are coded in various character sets, as well as methods for encoding
   such body parts as sequences of printable US-ASCII characters.  This
   memo describes similar techniques to allow the encoding of non-ASCII
   text in various portions of a RFC 822 [2] message header, in a manner
   which is unlikely to confuse existing message handling software.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Like the encoding techniques described in RFC 2045, the techniques
   outlined here were designed to allow the use of non-ASCII characters
   in message headers in a way which is unlikely to be disturbed by the
   quirks of existing Internet mail handling programs.  In particular,
   some mail relaying programs are known to (a) delete some message
   header fields while retaining others, (b) rearrange the order of
   addresses in To or Cc fields, (c) rearrange the (vertical) order of
   header fields, and/or (d) "wrap" message headers at different places
   than those in the original message.  In addition, some mail reading
   programs are known to have difficulty correctly parsing message
   headers which, while legal according to RFC 822, make use of
   backslash-quoting to "hide" special characters such as "<", ",", or
   ":", or which exploit other infrequently-used features of that
   specification.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   While it is unfortunate that these programs do not correctly
   interpret RFC 822 headers, to "break" these programs would cause
   severe operational problems for the Internet mail system.  The
   extensions described in this memo therefore do not rely on little-
   used features of RFC 822.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Instead, certain sequences of "ordinary" printable ASCII characters
   (known as "encoded-words") are reserved for use as encoded data.  The
   syntax of encoded-words is such that they are unlikely to
   "accidentally" appear as normal text in message headers.
   Furthermore, the characters used in encoded-words are restricted to
   those which do not have special meanings in the context in which the
   encoded-word appears.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Generally, an "encoded-word" is a sequence of printable ASCII
   characters that begins with "=?", ends with "?=", and has two "?"s in
   between.  It specifies a character set and an encoding method, and
   also includes the original text encoded as graphic ASCII characters,
   according to the rules for that encoding method.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   A mail composer that implements this specification will provide a
   means of inputting non-ASCII text in header fields, but will
   translate these fields (or appropriate portions of these fields) into
   encoded-words before inserting them into the message header.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   A mail reader that implements this specification will recognize
   encoded-words when they appear in certain portions of the message
   header.  Instead of displaying the encoded-word "as is", it will
   reverse the encoding and display the original text in the designated
   character set.
]PRE]


*** NOTES [INS[注意]]

[PRE[
   This memo relies heavily on notation and terms defined RFC 822 and
   RFC 2045.  In particular, the syntax for the ABNF used in this memo
   is defined in RFC 822, as well as many of the terminal or nonterminal
   symbols from RFC 822 are used in the grammar for the header
   extensions defined here.  Among the symbols defined in RFC 822 and
   referenced in this memo are: 'addr-spec', 'atom', 'CHAR', 'comment',
   'CTLs', 'ctext', 'linear-white-space', 'phrase', 'quoted-pair'.
   'quoted-string', 'SPACE', and 'word'.  Successful implementation of
   this protocol extension requires careful attention to the RFC 822
   definitions of these terms.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   When the term "ASCII" appears in this memo, it refers to the "7-Bit
   American Standard Code for Information Interchange", ANSI X3.4-1986.
   The MIME charset name for this character set is "US-ASCII".  When not
   specifically referring to the MIME charset name, this document uses
   the term "ASCII", both for brevity and for consistency with RFC 822.
   However, implementors are warned that the character set name must be
   spelled "US-ASCII" in MIME message and body part headers.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This memo specifies a protocol for the representation of non-ASCII
   text in message headers.  It specifically DOES NOT define any
   translation between "8-bit headers" and pure ASCII headers, nor is
   any such translation assumed to be possible.
]PRE]


** 2. Syntax of encoded-words [INS[encoded-word (符号化語) の構文]]

> An 'encoded-word' is defined by the following ABNF grammar.  The
notation of RFC 822 is used, with the exception that white space
characters MUST NOT appear between components of an 'encoded-word'.

「encoded-word」は次の [[ABNF]] 文法で定義します。
RFC 822 の記法を使いますが、[[空白間隔]]文字が「encoded-word」
の部品間に現れては'''いけません'''。

[PRE[
   encoded-word = "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="
]PRE]

[PRE[
   charset = token    ; see section 3
]PRE]

[PRE[
   encoding = token   ; see section 4
]PRE]

[PRE[
   token = 1*<Any CHAR except SPACE, CTLs, and especials>
]PRE]

[PRE[
   especials = "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" / "@" / "," / ";" / ":" / "
               <"> / "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" / "." / "="
]PRE]

[PRE[
   encoded-text = 1*<Any printable ASCII character other than "?"
                     or SPACE>
                  ; (but see "Use of encoded-words in message
                  ; headers", section 5)
]PRE]

> Both 'encoding' and 'charset' names are case-independent.  Thus the
charset name "ISO-8859-1" is equivalent to "iso-8859-1", and the
encoding named "Q" may be spelled either "Q" or "q".

「encoding」と「charset」の名前はどちらも大文字・小文字を
区別しません。ですから charset 名「ISO-8859-1」は
「iso-8859-1」と同じで、符号化方式名「Q」は「Q」とも「q」とも
綴ることが出来ます。

> An 'encoded-word' may not be more than 75 characters long, including
'charset', 'encoding', 'encoded-text', and delimiters.  If it is
desirable to encode more text than will fit in an 'encoded-word' of
75 characters, multiple 'encoded-word's (separated by CRLF SPACE) may
be used.

「encoded-word」は「charset」, 「encoding」, 「encoded-text」
と区切りを含めて75文字長より長くなってはなりません。
「encoded-word」で75文字を超える文字を符号化したい時は、
複数の「encoded-word」(CRLF SPACE で区切る) を使うことが出来ます。

> While there is no limit to the length of a multiple-line header
field, each line of a header field that contains one or more
'encoded-word's is limited to 76 characters.

複数行頭領域の長さの制限はないので、頭領域の各行は1つ以上の「encoded-word」
を含む頭領域の各行は76文字に制限します。

> The length restrictions are included both to ease interoperability
through internetwork mail gateways, and to impose a limit on the
amount of lookahead a header parser must employ (while looking for a
final ?= delimiter) before it can decide whether a token is an
"encoded-word" or something else.

長さの制限をするはネットワーク間メイル関門での相互通信を容易にし、
頭解析器の (最後の ?= 区切りを探して) token が 「encoded-word」
か他の何かか決める前の先読みの量を制限するためです。

> IMPORTANT: 'encoded-word's are designed to be recognized as 'atom's
by an RFC 822 parser.  As a consequence, unencoded white space
characters (such as SPACE and HTAB) are FORBIDDEN within an
'encoded-word'.  For example, the character sequence

重要: 「encoded-word」は RFC 822 解析器には「atom」と
みなされるように設計されています。ですから、符号化されていない
空白間隔文字 (SPACE や HTAB) は「encoded-word」では''禁止''します。
例えば、文字列

[PRE[
      =?iso-8859-1?q?this is some text?=
]PRE]

> would be parsed as four 'atom's, rather than as a single 'atom' (by
an RFC 822 parser) or 'encoded-word' (by a parser which understands
'encoded-words').  The correct way to encode the string "this is some
text" is to encode the SPACE characters as well, e.g.

は (RFC 822 解析器には) 1つの「atom」や (「encoded-word」を理解する解析器には) 
「encoded-word」ではなく、4つの「atom」と解析されます。
文字列「This is some text」を符号化する正しい方法は、
SPACE 文字を同様に符号化して次のようにするものです。

[PRE[
      =?iso-8859-1?q?this=20is=20some=20text?=
]PRE]

> The characters which may appear in 'encoded-text' are further
restricted by the rules in section 5.

「encoded-text」に現れる文字は第5章の規則で更に制限します。


** 3. Character sets [INS[文字集合]]

> The 'charset' portion of an 'encoded-word' specifies the character
set associated with the unencoded text.  A 'charset' can be any of
the character set names allowed in an MIME "charset" parameter of a
"text/plain" body part, or any character set name registered with
IANA for use with the MIME text/plain content-type.

> Some character sets use code-switching techniques to switch between
"ASCII mode" and other modes.  If unencoded text in an 'encoded-word'
contains a sequence which causes the charset interpreter to switch
out of ASCII mode, it MUST contain additional control codes such that
ASCII mode is again selected at the end of the 'encoded-word'.  (This
rule applies separately to each 'encoded-word', including adjacent
'encoded-word's within a single header field.)

幾つかの文字集合は「ASCII 状態」と他の状態を切り替えるのに
符号切り替え技術を使います。「encoded-word」中の符号化されていない文が、
charset 解釈者に ASCII 状態の他に切り替えさせる列である場合、
「encoded-word」の終わりで再び ASCII 状態に切り替える制御符号
を加えて入れなければ''なりません''。 (この規則は各「encoded-word」
にそれぞれ適用されます。単一頭領域内の隣接した「encoded-word」も含みます。)

> When there is a possibility of using more than one character set to
represent the text in an 'encoded-word', and in the absence of
private agreements between sender and recipients of a message, it is
recommended that members of the ISO-8859-* series be used in
preference to other character sets.

「encoded-word」中の文を表現する文字集合を複数使用できるときは、
メッセージの送信者と受信者の間の私的な合意が無い限り、
ISO-8859-* 系列のどれかを他の文字集合に優先して使用することを推奨します。


** 4. Encodings [INS[符号化]]

[PRE[
   Initially, the legal values for "encoding" are "Q" and "B".  These
   encodings are described below.  The "Q" encoding is recommended for
   use when most of the characters to be encoded are in the ASCII
   character set; otherwise, the "B" encoding should be used.
   Nevertheless, a mail reader which claims to recognize 'encoded-word's
   MUST be able to accept either encoding for any character set which it
   supports.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Only a subset of the printable ASCII characters may be used in
   'encoded-text'.  Space and tab characters are not allowed, so that
   the beginning and end of an 'encoded-word' are obvious.  The "?"
   character is used within an 'encoded-word' to separate the various
   portions of the 'encoded-word' from one another, and thus cannot
   appear in the 'encoded-text' portion.  Other characters are also
   illegal in certain contexts.  For example, an 'encoded-word' in a
   'phrase' preceding an address in a From header field may not contain
   any of the "specials" defined in RFC 822.  Finally, certain other
   characters are disallowed in some contexts, to ensure reliability for
   messages that pass through internetwork mail gateways.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The "B" encoding automatically meets these requirements.  The "Q"
   encoding allows a wide range of printable characters to be used in
   non-critical locations in the message header (e.g., Subject), with
   fewer characters available for use in other locations.
]PRE]


*** 4.1. The "B" encoding [INS["B" 符号化方式]]

> The "B" encoding is identical to the "BASE64" encoding defined by RFC 2045.

「B」符号化方式は RFC 2045 で定義された "BASE64"
符号化方式と同じです。


*** 4.2. The "Q" encoding [INS["Q" 符号化方式]]

> The "Q" encoding is similar to the "Quoted-Printable" content-
transfer-encoding defined in RFC 2045.  It is designed to allow text
containing mostly ASCII characters to be decipherable on an ASCII
terminal without decoding.

[PRE[
   (1) Any 8-bit value may be represented by a "=" followed by two
       hexadecimal digits.  For example, if the character set in use
       were ISO-8859-1, the "=" character would thus be encoded as
       "=3D", and a SPACE by "=20".  (Upper case should be used for
       hexadecimal digits "A" through "F".)
]PRE]

(2) The 8-bit hexadecimal value 20 (e.g., ISO-8859-1 SPACE) may be
represented as "_" (underscore, ASCII 95.).  (This character may
not pass through some internetwork mail gateways, but its use
will greatly enhance readability of "Q" encoded data with mail
readers that do not support this encoding.)  Note that the "_"
always represents hexadecimal 20, even if the SPACE character
occupies a different code position in the character set in use.

(2) 8ビットの16進値で 20 (ISO-8859-1 では SPACE (間隔)) は
「_」 (下線, ASCII 95) えで表現できます。 (この文字は
幾つかのネットワーク間メイル関門を通過できないかもしれませんが、 
この符号化法に対応していないメイル読者の「Q」符号化データ可読性を
非常に高めることになります。) なお、「_」は SPACE 文字が使われる
文字集合において他の符号位置にある場合であっても常に16進20を表現します。

(3) 8-bit values which correspond to printable ASCII characters other
than "=", "?", and "_" (underscore), MAY be represented as those
characters.  (But see section 5 for restrictions.)  In
particular, SPACE and TAB MUST NOT be represented as themselves
within encoded words.

(3) 「=」, 「?」, 「_」(下線) を除く印字可能な ASCII 文字に対応する
8ビット値はその文字で表現しても''構いません''。 (但し第5章の
制限も参照して下さい。) 特に、 SPACE と TAB は符号化語内で
自身を表現しては''なりません''。


** 5. Use of encoded-words in message headers [INS[encoded-word のメッセージ頭内での使用]]

> An 'encoded-word' may appear in a message header or body part header
according to the following rules:

> (1) An 'encoded-word' may replace a 'text' token (as defined by RFC 822)
in any Subject or Comments header field, any extension message
header field, or any MIME body part field for which the field body
is defined as '*text'.  An 'encoded-word' may also appear in any
user-defined ("X-") message or body part header field.

(1) 「encoded-word」は Subject (主題), Comments (注釈) 
頭欄や欄本体が「*text」と定義された拡張メッセージ頭欄, MIME
本体部分欄の「text」 token (RFC 822 で定義) を置き換えることが出来ます。
「encoded-word」は利用者定義 (「X-」) メッセージ/本体部分頭領域
に出現することも出来ます。

[INS[

訳注: 「拡張メッセージ頭欄, ''欄本体が『*text』と定義された'' MIME
本体部分欄」ではありません。 [[ietf-822]] の
<mid:200210141709.g9EH9c015818@astro.cs.utk.edu> を参照。
]INS]

> Ordinary ASCII text and 'encoded-word's may appear together in the
same header field.  However, an 'encoded-word' that appears in a
header field defined as '*text' MUST be separated from any adjacent
'encoded-word' or 'text' by 'linear-white-space'.

普通の ASCII 文と「encoded-word」は同じ頭欄に同時に出現出来ます。
しかし、「*text」と定義された頭欄内に出現する「encoded-word」
は他のどの隣接する「encoded-word」または「text」とも
「linear-white-space」で区切らなければ''なりません''。

> (2) An 'encoded-word' may appear within a 'comment' delimited by "(" and
")", i.e., wherever a 'ctext' is allowed.  More precisely, the RFC
822 ABNF definition for 'comment' is amended as follows:

(2) 「encoded-word」は「(」と「)」で区切られた「comment」(注釈)内、
つまり「ctext」が認められる場所で出現出来ます。より正確に言うと、
「comment」の RFC 822 ABNF 定義は次のように改訂されます。

[PRE[
    comment = "(" *(ctext / quoted-pair / comment / encoded-word) ")"
]PRE]

A "Q"-encoded 'encoded-word' which appears in a 'comment' MUST NOT
contain the characters "(", ")" or "
'encoded-word' that appears in a 'comment' MUST be separated from
any adjacent 'encoded-word' or 'ctext' by 'linear-white-space'.

「comment」中の「Q」符号化された「encoded-word」では
文字「(」, 「)」, 「\」は使っては''いけません''。
「comment」中に現れる「encoded-word」は他のどの「encoded-word」
や「ctext」とも「linear-white-space」で区切らなければ''なりません''。

;; 訳注: 原文「\」欠落

It is important to note that 'comment's are only recognized inside
"structured" field bodies.  In fields whose bodies are defined as
'*text', "(" and ")" are treated as ordinary characters rather than
comment delimiters, and rule (1) of this section applies.  (See RFC
822, sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3)

「comment」は「構造化」領域本体でのみ認識されることに
注意するのが重要です。本体が「*text」と定義された領域では
「(」や「)」は注釈区切りではなく普通の文字として扱われるので、
この節の規則(1)が適用されます。  (RFC 822 第3.1.2節, 第3.1.3節参照)

(3) As a replacement for a 'word' entity within a 'phrase', for example,
one that precedes an address in a From, To, or Cc header.  The ABNF
definition for 'phrase' from RFC 822 thus becomes:

(3) 「phrase」中の「word」実体を置き換えます。例えば
From (送信元), To (送信先), Cc (同報) 頭中のアドレスの前に
来るものです。 RFC 822 の「phrase」の ABNF 定義はですから次のようになります。

[PRE[
    phrase = 1*( encoded-word / word )
]PRE]

In this case the set of characters that may be used in a "Q"-encoded
'encoded-word' is restricted to: <upper and lower case ASCII
letters, decimal digits, "!", "*", "+", "-", "/", "=", and "_"
(underscore, ASCII 95.)>.  An 'encoded-word' that appears within a
'phrase' MUST be separated from any adjacent 'word', 'text' or
'special' by 'linear-white-space'.

この場合に「Q」符号化された「encoded-word」で使用可能な文字の集合は
<ASCII の大文字・小文字, 10進数字, 「!」, 「*」, 「+」, 「+」, 「-」, 
「/」, 「=」, 「_」(下線, ASCII 95)> に制限されます。
「phrase」中に現れる「encoded-word」は他のどの隣接する「word」,
「text」, 「special」とも「linear-white-space」で区切らなければ
''なりません''。

These are the ONLY locations where an 'encoded-word' may appear.  In particular:
これ''だけ''が「encoded-word」が出現できる場所です。
特に、

- An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT appear in any portion of an 'addr-spec'.
- An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT appear within a 'quoted-string'.
- An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT be used in a Received header field.
- An 'encoded-word' MUST NOT be used in parameter of a MIME Content-Type or Content-Disposition field, or in any structured field body except within a 'comment' or 'phrase'.

- 「encoded-word」は「addr-spec」のどこにも出現しては''いけません''。
- 「encoded-word」は「quoted-string」中に出現しては''いけません''。
- 「encoded-word」は Received (受信) 頭領域中で使用しては''いけません''。
- 「encoded-word」は MIME Content-Type (内容型), Content-Disposition 領域の parameter 中や「comment」や「phrase」内を除くどの構造化領域本体でも使用しては''いけません''。

[PRE[
   The 'encoded-text' in an 'encoded-word' must be self-contained;
   'encoded-text' MUST NOT be continued from one 'encoded-word' to
   another.  This implies that the 'encoded-text' portion of a "B"
   'encoded-word' will be a multiple of 4 characters long; for a "Q"
   'encoded-word', any "=" character that appears in the 'encoded-text'
   portion will be followed by two hexadecimal characters.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Each 'encoded-word' MUST encode an integral number of octets.  The
   'encoded-text' in each 'encoded-word' must be well-formed according
   to the encoding specified; the 'encoded-text' may not be continued in
   the next 'encoded-word'.  (For example, "=?charset?Q?=?=
   =?charset?Q?AB?=" would be illegal, because the two hex digits "AB"
   must follow the "=" in the same 'encoded-word'.)
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Each 'encoded-word' MUST represent an integral number of characters.
   A multi-octet character may not be split across adjacent 'encoded-
   word's.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Only printable and white space character data should be encoded using
   this scheme.  However, since these encoding schemes allow the
   encoding of arbitrary octet values, mail readers that implement this
   decoding should also ensure that display of the decoded data on the
   recipient's terminal will not cause unwanted side-effects.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Use of these methods to encode non-textual data (e.g., pictures or
   sounds) is not defined by this memo.  Use of 'encoded-word's to
   represent strings of purely ASCII characters is allowed, but
   discouraged.  In rare cases it may be necessary to encode ordinary
   text that looks like an 'encoded-word'.

NOTE: Decoding and display of encoded-words occurs *after* a
structured field body is parsed into tokens.  It is therefore
possible to hide 'special' characters in encoded-words which, when
displayed, will be indistinguishable from 'special' characters in the
surrounding text.  For this and other reasons, it is NOT generally
possible to translate a message header containing 'encoded-word's to
an unencoded form which can be parsed by an RFC 822 mail reader.

[PRE[
   When displaying a particular header field that contains multiple

addition, the mail reader must ensure that the output device is once
again in "ASCII mode" after the 'encoded-word' is displayed.

[PRE[
   A mail reader need not attempt to display the text associated with an
   'encoded-word' that is incorrectly formed.  However, a mail reader
   MUST NOT prevent the display or handling of a message because an
   'encoded-word' is incorrectly formed.

      group of 4 base64 characters representing 2 octets).  An additional
      octet could have been encoded in the first 'encoded-word' (so that
      the encoded-word would contain an exact multiple of 3 encoded

* [[RFC2231]] による修訂


** 5.  Language specification in Encoded Words

[PRE[
   RFC 2047 provides support for non-US-ASCII character sets in RFC 822
   message header comments, phrases, and any unstructured text field.
   This is done by defining an encoded word construct which can appear
   in any of these places.  Given that these are fields intended for
   display, it is sometimes necessary to associate language information
   with encoded words as well as just the character set.  This
   specification extends the definition of an encoded word to allow the
   inclusion of such information.  This is simply done by suffixing the
   character set specification with an asterisk followed by the language
   tag.  For example:
]PRE]

[PRE[
          From: =?US-ASCII*EN?Q?Keith_Moore?= <moore@cs.utk.edu>
]PRE]


** 7.  Modifications to MIME ABNF (抜粋)

[PRE[
   The ABNF given in RFC 2047 for encoded-words is:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   encoded-word := "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This specification changes this ABNF to:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   encoded-word := "=?" charset ["*" language] "?" encoded-text "?="
