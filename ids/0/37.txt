** Abstract


** 要約

[PRE[
   [RFC822] and [RFC1036] define so-called 'Message-IDs' that represent
   a unique identifier for email and netnews messages. A similar
   identifier is also used by [RFC2045] for the 'Content-ID' label.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   For each of these protocols, uniqueness of the identifiers generated
   is more or less essential. Unfortunately, the original Message-ID
   specification requires that the generator have an own, non-temporary
   full qualified domain name available, which does not allow hosts that
   are connected via dialup lines and get dynamically assigned IP
   addresses (and hostnames) to generate unique IDs offline.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This memo provides recommendations for the generation of such IDs
   without risking non-uniqueness.

** 1 Message-ID の書式と利用


*** 1.1 The Message-ID and Content-ID headers


*** 1.1 Message-ID, Content-ID 両ヘッダー

[PRE[
   The Message-ID is defined in [RFC822], to which [RFC1036] and
   [RFC2045] reference, as follows:
]PRE]

[PRE[
     msg-id      =  "<" addr-spec ">"            ; Unique message id
]PRE]

[PRE[
   NOTE: These IDs are used in special message headers, whose format is
   not important for this specification, which only deals with the part
   between the "<>"s.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   In this specification, the terms "Message-ID" and "Content-ID" or
   just "ID" refer to the part between the "<" and ">", which are
   considered delimiters.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   NOTE: This differs from [RFC822] and [RFC1036], where the angle
   brackets are considered part of the ID. However, the definition used
   herein is consistent with the use of such identifiers in other
   protocols, such as URIs.
]PRE]


*** 1.2 Syntax for IDs


*** 1.2 ID の構文

[PRE[
   The syntax of IDs is defined in [RFC822] as being the same as that of
   domain-based Internet email addresses:
]PRE]

[PRE[
     addr-spec   =  local-part "@" domain
]PRE]


*** 1.3 Uniqueness of Message-IDs and Content-IDs


*** 1.3 Message-ID と Content-ID の固有性

[PRE[
   According to [RFC822], Message-IDs "are" unique, i.e. not reused for
   other email messages.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   [RFC1036] RECOMMENDS Message-IDs to be unique for at least two years.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   [RFC2045] says Content-IDs are world-unique "like Message-ID values".
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This memo RECOMMENDS that IDs are generated in a way that guarantees
   uniqueness for an unlimited period of time. The methods presented
   here fulfil this recommendation.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   None of the specifications above says whether reusing an IDs of one
   type as the ID of another type (e.g. using the same ID as a Message-
   ID and as a Content-ID) is allowed. As any ID generator must be able
   to generate an arbitrary number of unique IDs, reusing IDs of one
   type for other types of IDs is PROHIBITED.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   As a special exception, for messages sent via both email and news,
   both copies may use the same Message-ID, provided both copies are
   considered the same.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   NOTE: The exact definition of being "the same" is beyond the scope of
   this memo.
]PRE]


** 2 Message ID format


** 2 メッセージ ID 書式

To guarantee uniqueness, IDs consist of two elements:

固有性を保証するために、 ID は2つの要素からなります。

namespace: An identifier derived from managed databases such as the
DNS. The owner of an ID namespace is the owner of the identifier
assigned by that database.

名前空間: DNS のような管理されたデータベースから派生した識別子。
ID 名前空間の所有者はそのデータベースにより割り当てられる識別子の所有者です。

unique: A more or less arbitrary string, whose uniqueness is
guaranteed by the owner of the ID namespace.

unique (固有): 多少自由度のある文字列で、その固有性は
ID 名前空間の所有者により保証されます。

Traditionally, the namespace was the right hand side of message ID.
This is no longer true. See sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 for details.

伝統的には、名前空間はメッセージ ID の右側でした。これはもはや真ではありません。
詳しくは第2.1.2節と第2.1.3節を参照して下さい。


*** 2.1 Message ID namespaces


*** 2.1 メッセージ ID 名前空間


**** 2.1.1 Based on the Host's Full Qualified Domain Name


**** 2.1.1 ホストの完全修飾ドメイン名に基づく

[PRE[
   If the host generating the ID has an own, not dynamically assigned
   host name, this name MAY be used:
]PRE]

[PRE[
     fqdn-id      := unique "@" fqdn
     fqdn         := <name of the host generating the id>
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The host name MUST be a full qualified domain name of the host.
   CNAMEs are ALLOWED. It is not required (OPTIONAL) that the FQDN be
   visible in the DNS as long as it has been assigned to a host owner by
   the authority of the domain it belongs to and it is syntactically
   valid.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   NOTE: This allows providers that use dialup lines to assign "host
   names" solely for the purpose of offline ID creation to their
   customers.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The person who is responsible for running software that creates IDs
   of this type SHOULD have the explicit permission of the host owner.
   This may be the owner him/herself, the administrator or a privileged
   user.

**** 2.1.2 電子メイル・アドレスに基づく

[PRE[
   If messages are prepared offline, a static FQDN or IP address may not
   be available. For this case, IDs may be generated from the owner's
   email address:
]PRE]

[PRE[
     email-id     := unique "%" addr-spec
]PRE]

[PRE[
   NOTE that addr-spec contains the required "@".
]PRE]

The local part MAY be passed through a non-reversible hash function,
such as the standard POSIX crypt(). In this case, the delimiter
SHOULD be "%%" or "%<hash function>%" instead of "%":

地方部分は標準 POSIX crypt() のような非可逆ハッシュ関数を通しても''良い''。
この場合、区切りは「%%」または「%<ハッシュ関数>%」を「%」の代わりに
使う''べき''です。

[PRE[
     emailhash-id := unique "%" [hash-name] "%" local-part "@" domain
     hash-name    := "crypt" / "md5" / "sha1" / ...
]PRE]

NOTE that hash functions do not guarantee uniqueness. Account
managers should warn users if two local-parts in the same domain
produce the same result with one commonly used hash function.

参考 ハッシュ関数は固有性を保証しません。
アカウント管理者は同じドメインの2つの local-part が

*** 2.2 Generating the "unique" part


*** 2.2 「固有」部分を生成する

[PRE[
   The "unique" part is the part that changes from ID to ID generated
   by the same entity. The uniqueness is guaranteed by the owner of the
   ID namespace it is used in. It is important to use a scheme that
   makes it very unlikely, better impossible, that the same "unique"
   string will be generated twice.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The "unique" part is often derived from a combination of the
   following data:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   * the current date and time
   * the process and thread id of the generating service
   * a sequence number
   * the name of the software generating the ID
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The data MAY be encoded in some way, to make IDs shorter and to
   make clear that the unique part of IDs SHOULD NOT be interpreted.
   Examples for such encodings are MIME Base64 [RFC2045] (preferably
   of the binary representation of the data), Hex (Base 16), etc.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Because IDs can occur very frequently in some protocols, particuarly
   in References lines of mail and news messages, all efforts should be
   made to make them compact, as long as they remain unique.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The full set of characters that MAY be freely used for the encoded
   form is:
]PRE]

[PRE[
      unique-chars := "A".."Z" / "a".."z" / "1".."9"
                     / "!" / "#" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-"
                     / "/" / "=" / "?" / "^" / "_" / "`" / "{" / "|"
                     / "}" / "~"                         ; 80 characters
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The dot (".") MAY be used everywhere except the beginning and the
   end, e.g. as a field separator.
]PRE]

[PRE[
      unique-word := 1*unique-chars
      unique      := unique-word *( "." unique-word )
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The percent sign ("%") is NOT RECOMMENDED due to its use as a
   separator for the email and login+FQDN namespaces (sections 2.1.3 and
   2.1.4). The use of "quoted-string"s is NOT RECOMMENDED for
   compatibiliby with buggy software.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   NOTE that protocols that use IDs MAY allow additional syntax elements
   within the IDs, such as comments or line breaks. These are not
   considered part of the ID.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Generators MAY encrypt IDs with reversible methods. Non-reversible
   hash functions SHOULD NOT be used, as they usually do not guarantee
   uniqueness.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Example for ID generating schemes:
      <microseconds since 1970-01-01, base 36-encoded> "." <process id,
      base 36-encoded>
]PRE]

[PRE[
      <seconds since 1960-01-01, hex-encoded> "." <internal counter>
]PRE]

[PRE[
      <number of 100ns intervals since 1600-01-01, base 80-encoded> "."
      <process and thread id, base 80-encoded> "." <LAN computer name>
]PRE]

[PRE[
   (These are provided as examples, not as a recommendation.)
]PRE]


**** 2.2.1 Current Date and Time


**** 2.2.1 現在日時

[PRE[
   The current date and time MUST be used, as it is the only data that
   changes regularly and most reliably. The highest available resolution
   is RECOMMENDED.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   To make it impossible that two IDs are generated by the same process
   within the lowest measurable time on the system, the generating
   process may either sleep until the system time changes or simulate a
   higher resolution by incrementing an internal counter.
]PRE]


**** 2.2.2 Process and Thread ID


**** 2.2.2 プロセスおよびスレッドの ID

[PRE[
   As different processes might generate IDs at exactly the same time,
   the time alone may not be sufficient on multitasking systems. To
   avoid clashes, the process ID and - if the generating process is
   multithreaded - the thread ID MAY be used.
]PRE]


**** 2.2.3 Sequence Number


**** 2.2.3 連番

[PRE[
   A sequence number that is incremented for every ID and stored in a
   file MAY be used to make clashes less likely.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   However, an ID generator MUST NOT, repeat MUST NOT use such counters
   as the only source for the generation of the unique part, as this
   will result in clashes in case the file is deleted and/or restored
   from a backup.
]PRE]


**** 2.2.4 Software name


**** 2.2.4 ソフトウェア名

[PRE[
   The name of the software MAY be used to avoid that users switching
   their software will accidentally have the same "unique" string
   created from different input data processed differently.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Note: The software name should be as short as possible, there should
   not be a version number of the software, unless the generation
   algorithm changes in a way that would make clashes possible.
]PRE]


**** 2.2.5 Other Unique Data Sources


**** 2.2.5 他の固有データ源

[PRE[
   Other sources that may be used to guarantee or further enhance the
   probability of uniqueness include:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   * The host's Ethernet MAC address.
   * The host's LAN name (not full qualified).
   * Data entered by the user told to enter a unique string.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   It might be wise to use these together with email based (section
   2.1.2) namespaces, as the same user can work on different machines.
]PRE]


** 3 Security considerations


** 3 安全性に関して


*** 3.1 Namespace Invasions


*** 3.1 名前空間侵犯

[PRE[
   Message IDs are traditionally insecure. There is currently no method
   to prevent Message IDs from being faked.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Accidental or intentional clashes of IDs have different impact
   depending on the protocol they are used for. Each protocol
   specification using IDs MUST address the security issues raised and
   SHOULD provide methods to prevent abuse of ID namespaces owned by
   others.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Future standards MAY associate ID namespaces with public/private key
   pairs and require authentication on a per-namespace basis.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Using encryption of the unique part (see section 2.2) makes it harder
   to guess the next IDs generated for denial of service attacks.
]PRE]


*** 3.2 Revealing Information about the Generating system


*** 3.2 生成系の情報を見せる

[PRE[
   Implementers and users are warned that the following information
   might be derived by the analysis of message IDs:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   * host the ID was generated on
   * email address of the user (also as combination of login@fqdn)
   * date and time when the ID was generated
   * resolution of the system's clock
   * operating system (from thread and process IDs)
   * software used (also from structure of the unique string)
]PRE]

[PRE[
   By encrypting the unique part (see section 2.2) or using hash
   functions (see section 2.1.2), this can be made nearly impossible.
