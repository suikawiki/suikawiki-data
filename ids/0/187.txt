
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)。

RFC 1991 曰く:

> PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) uses a combination of public-key and
> conventional encryption to provide security services for electronic
> mail messages and data files.  These services include confidentiality
> and digital signature.  PGP is widely used throughout the global
> computer community.  This document describes the format of "PGP
> files", i.e., messages that have been encrypted and/or signed with PGP.

> PGP was created by Philip Zimmermann and first released, in Version
> 1.0, in 1991. Subsequent versions have been designed and implemented
> by an all-volunteer collaborative effort under the design guidance of
> Philip Zimmermann.  PGP and Pretty Good Privacy are trademarks of
> Philip Zimmermann.
