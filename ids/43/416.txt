>According to chief scientist A'Hearn,[SUP[__&&[&&__79__&&]&&__]] the reason for the software malfunction was a Y2K-like problem. August 11, 2013, 00:38:49.6, was 2[SUP[32]] tenth-seconds (deciseconds) from January 1, 2000, leading to speculation that a system on the craft tracked time in one-tenth second increments since January 1, 2000, and stored it in an unsigned 32-bit integer, which then overflowed at this time, similar to the Year 2038 problem.[SUP[__&&[&&__80__&&]&&__]]
