* Abstract

> The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used
to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to
another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics
that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range
of applications. This specification extends HTML to support a wide
variety of tables. The model is designed to work well with associated
style sheets, but does not require them. It also supports rendering
to braille, or speech, and exchange of tabular data with databases
and spreadsheets. The HTML table model embodies certain aspects of
the CALS table model, e.g. the ability to group table rows into
thead, tbody and tfoot sections, plus the ability to specify cell
alignment compactly for sets of cells according to the context.

* Recent Changes [INS[最近の変更点]]

> This specification extends HTML to support tables. The table model
has grown out of early work on HTML+ and the initial draft of HTML3.
The earlier model has been been extended in response to requests from
information providers for improved control over the presentation of
tabular information:

この仕様書は表に対応するため HTML を拡張します。
表__&&model&&__は早期の HTML+ の作業及び HTML3 の初期の原案で検討されました。
早期の__&&model&&__は、情報提供者からの表情報の表現の制御性の向上の要求を受けて拡張しました。

- alignment on designated characters such as "." and ":"
e.g. aligning a column of numbers on the decimal point
- more flexibility in specifying table frames and rules
- incremental display for large tables as data is received
- the ability to support scrollable tables with fixed headers plus
better support for breaking tables across pages for printing
- optional column based defaults for alignment properties

- 「.」や「:」のような特定文字で揃える。例えば数値の欄を小数点で揃える。
- 表枠・規則をより柔軟に指定
- 大きな表をデータを受信しながら拡張しつつ表示
- __&&header&&__を固定して__&&scroll&&__可能及び頁をまたぐ印刷で表をより良く分解することに対応する能力
- 任意で行ごとの配置属性の既定値

> In addition, a major goal has been to provide backwards compatibility
with the widely deployed Netscape implementation of tables. A
subsidiary goal has been to simplify importing tables conforming to
the SGML CALS model. The latest draft makes the ALIGN attribute
compatible with the latest Netscape and Microsoft browsers. Some
clarifications have been made to the role of the DIR attribute and
recommended behaviour when absolute and relative column widths are mixed.

加えて、大きな目標として、広く採用されている Netscape の表の実装との後方互換性を保つことがあります。
副次的な目標としては、 SGML CALS __&&model&&__に適合する表を簡単に__&&import&&__可能とします。
この最新の原案は [CODE(HTML)[ALIGN]] 属性を最新の Netscape
や Microsoft の__&&browser&&__と互換にします。
[CODE(HTML)[DIR]] 属性の役割及び行幅に絶対値と相対値が混合されていた場合の推奨される動作の明確化を行います。

> A new element COLGROUP has been introduced to allow sets of columns
be grouped with different width and alignment properties specified by
one or more COL elements. The semantics of COLGROUP have been
clarified over previous drafts, and RULES=BASIC replaced by RULES=GROUPS.

新しい要素 [CODE(HTML)[COLGROUP]] を導入し、1つ以上の [CODE(HTML)[COL]]
要素で指定された異なる幅・配置属性を持った行の集合を集団化することを可能にします。
[CODE(HTML)[COLGROUP]] の意味を以前の原案の元で明確化し、
[CODE(HTML)[RULES=BASIC]] は [CODE(HTML)[RULES=GROUPS]]
で置き換えます。

> The FRAME and RULES attributes have been modified to avoid SGML name
clashes with each other, and to avoid clashes with the ALIGN and
VALIGN attributes. These changes were additionally motivated by the
desire to avoid future problems if this specification is extended to
allow FRAME and RULES attributes with other table elements.

[CODE(HTML)[FRAME]] 及び [CODE(HTML)[RULES]] 両属性並びに
[CODE(HTML)[ALIGN]] 及び [CODE(HTML)[VALIGN]] 両属性は、互いに SGML
名が衝突することを防ぐため修正します。
これらの変更は、将来この仕様が拡張されて [CODE(HTML)[FRAME]]
及び [CODE(HTML)[RULES]] の両属性が他の表要素にも認められるようになったときに問題が起こるのを避ける意味合いもあります。


* A Brief Introduction to HTML Tables [INS[HTML 表の概観]]

> Tables start with an optional caption followed by one or more rows.
Each row is formed by one or more cells, which are differentiated
into header and data cells. Cells can be merged across rows and
columns, and include attributes assisting rendering to speech and
braille, or for exporting table data into databases. The model
provides limited support for control over appearence, for example
horizontal and vertical alignment of cell contents, border styles and
cell margins. You can further affect this by grouping rows and
columns together. Tables can contain a wide range of content, such as
headers, lists, paragraphs, forms, figures, preformatted text and
even nested tables.

表は省略可能な[RUBYB[題] [caption]]から始まり、1つ以上の[RUBYB[列] [row]]が続きます。各列は1つ以上の__&&cell&&__で構成され、__&&cell&&__は__&&header cell&&__と__&&data cell&&__に分類されます。
__&&cell&&__は行方向又は列方向に合併することや、発話又は点字で__&&rendering&&__する或いは__&&database&&__に__&&export&&__するのを補助する属性を含めることが出来ます。
この__&&model&&__では__&&cell&&__内容の水平及び垂直方向の揃え位置,
枠線様式及び__&&cell&&__の余白のような見た目をある程度制御することが出来ます。
行や列を集団化することで更にこれを行えます。
表は__&&heading&&__, __&&list&&__, 段落, __&&form&&__,
図, __&&preformatted text&&__, それに入れ子の表など様々なものを含められます。

*Design Rationale [INS[設計論]]
>The HTML table model has evolved from studies of existing SGML tables
models, the treatment of tables in common word processing packages,
and looking at a wide range of tabular layout in magazines, books and
other paper-based documents. The model was chosen to allow simple
tables to be expressed simply with extra complexity only when needed.
This makes it practical to create the markup for HTML tables with
everyday text editors and reduces the learning curve for getting
started. This feature has been very important to the success of HTML 
to date.
]PRE]

HTML 表__&&model&&__は既存の SGML 表__&&model&&__,
文書処理__&&package&&__における表の扱いの研究及び雑誌・本や他の紙文書での表__&&layout&&__の広範囲の調査より発展しています。
この__&&model&&__は単純な表は簡潔に表現出来、必要な時にだけ複雑となるように選びました。
このため日常的な__&&text editor&&__での HTML 表の__&&markup&&__の作成及び開始のための__&&learning curve&&__の削減が現実的になります。
この機能は HTML の成功に非常に重要です。

> Increasingly people are using filters from other document formats or
direct wysiwyg editors for HTML. It is important that the HTML table
model fits well with these routes for authoring HTML. This affects
how the representation handles cells which span multiple rows or
columns, and how alignment and other presentation properties are
associated with groups of cells.

他の文書形式から HTML に濾過したり直接 WYSIWYG __&&editor&&__を使う人が増えています。
HTML 表__&&model&&__がこうした HTML の書き方とよく合うことが重要です。
このことは複数の行・列をまたぐ__&&cell&&__の取扱いの表現や揃え位置その他の表現属性を__&&cell&&__の集団と関連付ける方法に影響しています。

> A major consideration for the HTML table model is that the fonts and
window sizes etc. in use with browsers are not under the author's
control. This makes it risky to rely on column widths specified in
terms of absolute units such as picas or pixels. Instead, tables can
be dynamically sized to match the current window size and fonts.
Authors can provide guidance as to the relative widths of columns,
but user agents should to ensure that columns are wide enough to
render the width of the largest single element of the cell's content.
If the author's specification must be overridden, it is preferred
that the relative widths of individual columns are not changed drastically.

HTML 表__&&model&&__の大きな考慮点は、__&&borwser&&__で使われる__&&font&&__や__&&window size&&__などは著者の制御の及ぶ範囲ではないことです。
このため__&&pica&&__や__&&pixel&&__のような絶対単位で指定された行の幅を当てにすることは危険です。
代わりに、表は現在の__&&window size&&__や__&&font&&__に応じて動的に大きさを設定できます。
著者は行の相対幅の手引きを提供できますが、__&&user agent&&__は__&&cell&&__の内容の最大の一つの要素の幅を__&&rendering&&__できる十分な広さを行が確保できる__&&should&&_。
著者の指定が上書きされなければならないときは、個々の行の相対幅は徹底的に変更しないのが好ましいです。

> For large tables or slow network connections, it is desirable to be
able to start displaying the table before all of the data has been
received. The default window width for most user agents shows about
80 characters, and the graphics for many HTML pages are designed with
these defaults in mind. Authors can provide a hint to user agents to
activate incremental display of table contents. This feature requires
the author to specify the number of columns, and includes provision
for control of table width and the widths of different columns in
relative or absolute terms.

大きな表又は低速ネットワーク接続では、全てのデータを受信する前に表を表示し始めることが出来るのが望ましいです。
ほとんどの__&&user agent&&__の既定の__&&window&&__幅は80文字くらいで、多くの
HTML __&&page&&__の図画はこの既定値を考慮して設計されています。
著者は__&&user agent&&__に拡張しつつの表内容の表示を活性化するヒントを提供できます。
この機能には著者が行数を指定することと、相対的又は絶対的な表幅及び異なる行の幅の制御の準備を含めることが必要です。

> For incremental display, the browser needs the number of columns and
their widths. The default width of the table is the current window
size (width="100%"). This can be altered by including a WIDTH
attribute in the TABLE start tag. By default all columns have the
same width, but you can specify column widths with one or more COL
elements before the table data starts.

拡張しつつの表示では、__&&browser&&__は行の数とその幅を必要とします。
表の幅の既定値は現在の__&&window size&&__ ([CODE(HTML)[width="100%"]])
です。これは [CODE(HTML)[TABLE]] 開始__&&tag&&__の
[CODE(HTML)[WIDTH]] 属性を含めることで代替出来ます。
既定では全ての行が同じ幅ですが、表のデータが始まる前に一つ以上の
[CODE(HTML)[COL]] 要素で行幅を指定することが出来ます。

> The remaining issue is the number of columns. Some people have
suggested waiting until the first row of the table has been received,
but this could take a long time if the cells have a lot of content.
On the whole it makes more sense, when incremental display is
desired, to get authors to explicitly specify the number of columns
in the TABLE start tag.

残る問題は行の数です。表の最初の列を受信するまで待つことを提案した人もいますが、__&&cell&&__が多くの内容を持っていた場合多くの時間がかかります。
拡張しつつの表示がのぞましいときは、概して著者が陽に行数を
[CODE(HTML)[TABLE]] 開始__&&tag&&__に指定したほうが意味があります。

> Authors still need a way of informing the browser whether to use
incremental display or to automatically size the table to match the
cell contents. For the two pass auto sizing mode, the number of
columns is determined by the first pass, while for the incremental
mode, the number of columns needs to be stated up front. So it seems
to that COLS=_nn_ would be better for this purpose than a LAYOUT
attribute such as LAYOUT=FIXED or LAYOUT=AUTO.

著者は依然__&&browser&&__が拡張しつつの表示を使うか自動的に表を__&&cell&&__内容に合った大きさにするかの情報を入れる必要があります。
2段階自動大きさ合わせ__&&mode&&__では、行の数は第1段階決定され、拡張しつつ__&&mode&&__では行の数は最初にある必要があります。
ですからこの目的では [CODE(HTML)[LAYOUT=FIXED]] や [CODE(HTML)[KAYOUT=AUTO]]
のような [CODE(HTML)[LAYOUT]] 属性よりは [CODE(HTML)[COLS=_nn_]]
のほうが良いでしょう。

> It is generally held useful to consider documents from two
perspectives: Structural idioms such as headers, paragraphs, lists,
tables, and figures; and rendering idioms such as margins, leading,
font names and sizes. The wisdom of past experience encourages us to
separate the structural information in documents from rendering
information. Mixing them together ends up causing increased cost of
ownership for maintaining documents, and reduced portability between
applications and media.

通常、文書を二つの角度から考えるのが有用です。
__&&heading&&__, 段落, __&&list&&__, 表, 図のような構造表現と、余白,
__&&leading&&__, __&&font&&__の名前や大きさのような__&&rendering&&__表現です。
過去の経験からの知恵に従うなら文書の構造情報は__&&rendering&&__情報から分けた方が良いです。
この2つを混合することは文書を維持する費用がかさみ、応用と媒体の間の可搬性を減らすこととなります。

> For tables, the alignment of text within table cells, and the borders
between cells are, from the purist's point of view, rendering
information. In practice, though, it is useful to group these with
the structural information, as these features are highly portable
from one application to the next. The HTML table model leaves most
rendering information to associated style sheets. The model is
designed to take advantage of such style sheets but not to require them.

表については、表の__&&cell&&__の中の__&&text&&__の配置や__&&cell&&__間の枠線は__&&purist&&__の視点からすれば、__&&rendering&&__情報です。
しかし実際のところ、これらを構造情報と共に分類することは、これらの機能がある応用から次の応用へと非常に可搬ですから有用です。
HTML 表__&&model&&__はほとんどの__&&rendering&&__情報を関連付けられた__&&style sheet&&__に委ねます。
この__&&model&&__はそうした__&&style sheet&&__で優位に設計されていますが、必須ではありません。

> This specification provides a superset of the simpler model presented
in earlier work on HTML+. Tables are considered as being formed from
an optional caption together with a sequence of rows, which in turn
consist of a sequence of table cells. The model further
differentiates header and data cells, and allows cells to span
multiple rows and columns.

この仕様書は早期の HTML+ の作業で提示された比較的単純な__&&model&&__の__&&superset&&__を提供します。
表は省略可能な表題と列の連続があって、列は表__&&cell&&__の連続で構成される形と考えられます。
この__&&model&&__は更に__&&header cell&&__と__&&data cell&&__を区別し、__&&cell&&__は行や列をまたぐことが出来ます。

> Following the CALS table model, this specification allows table rows
to be grouped into head and body and foot sections. This simplifies
the representation of rendering information and can be used to repeat
table head and foot rows when breaking tables across page boundaries,
or to provide fixed headers above a scrollable body panel. In the
markup, the foot section is placed before the body sections. This is
an optimization shared with CALS for dealing with very long tables.
It allows the foot to be rendered without having to wait for the
entire table to be processed.

CALS 表__&&model&&__に倣い、この仕様では表の列を__&&(table)head&&__,
__&&(table)body&&__, __&&(table)foot&&__に集団化することが出来ます。
このため__&&rendering&&__情報の表現が簡単になり、頁境界を越えるため表を分解する時に__&&(table)head&&__列や__&&(table)foot&&__列を繰り返すことが出来、また__&&scroll&&__可能な__&&(table)body&&__部分の上に固定の__&&(table)head&&__を配置出来ます。
__&&markup&&__上では、__&&(table)foot&&__は__&&(table)body&&__の前に置かれます。
これは CALS でと同じく非常に長い表を処理するための最適化です。
これによって表全体を処理するのを待つことなしに__&&(table)foot&&__を__&&rendering&&__することが出来ます。

> For the visually impaired, HTML offers the hope of setting to rights
the damage caused by the adoption of windows based graphical user
interfaces. The HTML table model includes attributes for labeling
each cell, to support high quality text to speech conversion. The
same attributes can also be used to support automated import and
export of table data to databases or spreadsheets.

視覚障害者に対しては、 HTML は__&&window&&__を基にした__&&graphical user interface&&__の採用に伴い発生する被害を改善できるかもしれません。
HTML 表__&&model&&__は各__&&cell&&__に札付けして、発話合成のための高品質__&&text&&__に対応する属性を含んでいます。
この属性は__&&database&&__や__&&spreadsheet&&__とのデータの__&&import&&__や__&&export&&__の自動化に対応するのにも使えます。

[PRE[
   Current desktop publishing packages provide very rich control over
   the rendering of tables, and it would be impractical to reproduce
   this in HTML, without making HTML into a bulky rich text format like
   RTF or MIF. This specification does, however, offer authors the
   ability to choose from a set of commonly used classes of border
   styles. The FRAME attribute controls the appearence of the border
   frame around the table while the RULES attribute determines the
   choice of rulings within the table.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   During the development of this specification, a number of avenues
   were investigated for specifying the ruling patterns for tables. One
   issue concerns the kinds of statements that can be made. Including
   support for edge subtraction as well as edge addition leads to
   relatively complex algorithms. For instance work on allowing the full
   set of table elements to include the FRAME and RULES attributes led
   to an algorithm involving some 24 steps to determine whether a
   particular edge of a cell should be ruled or not. Even this
   additional complexity doesn't provide enough rendering control to
   meet the full range of needs for tables. The current specification
   deliberately sticks to a simple intuitive model, sufficient for most
   purposes. Further experimental work is needed before a more complex
   approach is standardized.

[PRE[
   ID
       Used to define a document-wide identifier. This can be used for
       naming positions within documents as the destination of a
       hypertext link. It may also be used by style sheets for
       rendering an element in a unique style. An ID attribute value is
       an SGML NAME token. NAME tokens are formed by an initial letter
       followed by letters, digits, "-" and "." characters. The letters
       are restricted to A-Z and a-z.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   CLASS
       A space separated list of SGML NAME tokens. CLASS names specify
       that the element belongs to the corresponding named classes. It
       allows authors to distinguish different roles played by the same
       tag. The classes may be used by style sheets to provide
       different renderings as appropriate to these roles.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   LANG
       A LANG attribute identifies the natural language used by the
       content of the associated element.The syntax and registry of
       language values are defined by RFC 1766. In summary the language
       is given as a primary tag followed by zero or more subtags,
       separated by "-". White space is not allowed and all tags are
       case insensitive. The name space of tags is administered by
       IANA. The two letter primary tag is an ISO 639 language
       abbreviation, while the initial subtag is a two letter ISO 3166
       country code. Example values for LANG include:

[PRE[
   DIR
       Human writing systems are grouped into scripts, which determine
       amongst other things, the direction the characters are written.
       Elements of the Latin script are nominally left to right, while
       those of the Arabic script are nominally right to left. These
       characters have what is called strong directionality. Other
       characters can be directionally neutral (spaces) or weak
       (punctuation).
]PRE]

[PRE[
       The DIR attribute specifies an encapsulation boundary which
       governs the interpretation of neutral and weakly directional
       characters. It does not override the directionality of strongly
       directional characters. The DIR attribute value is one of LTR
       for left to right, or RTL for right to left, e.g. DIR=RTL.
]PRE]

[PRE[
       When applied to TABLE, it indicates the geometric layout of rows
       (i.e. row 1 is on right if DIR=RTL, but on the left if DIR=LTR)
       and it indicates a default base directionality for any text in
       the table's content if no other DIR attribute applies to that
       text.
]PRE]


* Horizontal and Vertical Alignment Attributes

[PRE[
   The alignment of cell contents can be specified on a cell by cell
   basis, or inherited from enclosing elements, such as the row, column
   or the table element itself.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   ALIGN
       This specifies the horizontal alignment of cell contents.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   <!-- horizontal alignment attributes for cell contents -->
   <!ENTITY % cell.halign
           "align  (left|center|right|justify|char) #IMPLIED

            charoff CDATA   #IMPLIED -- offset for alignment char --"
           >
]PRE]

[PRE[
       The attribute value should be one of LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT,
       JUSTIFY and CHAR. User agents may treat JUSTIFY as left
       alignment if they lack support for text justification.
       ALIGN=CHAR is used for aligning cell contents on a particular
       character.

]PRE]

[PRE[
       For cells spanning multiple rows or columns, where the alignment
       property is inherited from the row or column, the initial row
       and column for the cell determines the appropriate alignment
       property to use.
]PRE]

[PRE[
       Note that an alignment attribute on elements within the cell,
       e.g. on a P element, overrides the normal alignment value for
       the cell.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   CHAR
       This is used to specify an alignment character for use with
       align=char, e.g. char=":". The default character is the decimal
       point for the current language, as set by the LANG attribute.
       The CHAR attribute value is case sensitive.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   CHAROFF
       Specifies the offset to the first occurrence of the alignment
       character on each line. If a line doesn't include the alignment
       character, it should be horizontally shifted to end at the
       alignment position. The resolved direction of the cell, as
       determined by the inheritance of the DIR attribute, is used to
       set whether the offset is from the left or right margin of the
       cell. For Latin scripts, the offset will be from the left
       margin, while for Arabic scripts, it will be from the right
       margin. In addition to standard units, the "%" sign may be used
       to indicate that the value specifies the alignment position as a
       percentage offset of the current cell, e.g. CHAROFF="30%"
       indicates the alignment character should be positioned 30%
       through the cell.
]PRE]

[PRE[
       When using the two pass layout algorithm, the default alignment
       position in the absence of an explicit or inherited CHAROFF
       attribute can be determined by choosing the position that would
       center lines for which the width before and after the alignment
       character are at the maximum values for any of the lines in the
       column for which ALIGN=CHAR. For incremental table layout the
       suggested default is CHAROFF="50%". If several cells in
       different rows for the same column use character alignment, then
       by default, all such cells should line up, regardless of which
       character is used for alignment. Rules for handling objects too
       large for column apply when the explicit or implied alignment
       results in a situation where the data exceeds the assigned width
       of the column.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   VALIGN
       Defines whether the cell contents are aligned with the top,
       middle or bottom of the cell.

               >
]PRE]

[PRE[
       If present, the value of the attribute should be one of: TOP,
       MIDDLE, BOTTOM or BASELINE. All cells in the same row with
       valign=baseline should be vertically positioned so that the
       first text line in each such cell occur on a common baseline.
       This constraint does not apply to subsequent text lines in these
       cells.
]PRE]

Inheritance Order

[PRE[
   Alignment properties can be included with most of the table elements:
   COL, THEAD, TBODY, TFOOT, TR, TH and TD. When rendering cells,
   horizontal alignment is determined by columns in preference to rows,
   while for vertical alignment, the rows are more important than the
   columns. The following table gives the detailed precedence order for
   each attribute, where X > Y denotes that X takes precedence over Y:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   ALIGN, CHAR and CHAROFF:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   cells > columns > column groups > rows > row groups > default
]PRE]

[PRE[
   VALIGN, LANG, and DIR:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   cells > rows > row groups > columns > column groups > table > default
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Where cells are defined by TH and TD elements; rows by TR elements;
   row groups by THEAD, TBODY and TFOOT elements, columns by COL
   elements; and column groups by COLGROUP and COL elements. Note that
   there is no inheritance mechanism for the CLASS attribute.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Properties defined on cells take precedence over inherited
   properties, but are in turn over-ridden by alignment properties on
   elements within cells. In the absence of an ALIGN attribute along the
   inheritance path, the recommended default alignment for table cell
   contents is ALIGN=LEFT for table data and ALIGN=CENTER for table
   headers. The recommended default for vertical alignment is
   VALIGN=MIDDLE. These defaults are chosen to match the behaviour of
   the widely deployed Netscape implementation.
]PRE]

Standard Units for Widths

[PRE[
   Several attributes specify widths as a number followed by an optional
   suffix. The units for widths are specified by the suffix: pt denotes
   points, pi denotes picas, in denotes inches, cm denotes centimeters,

[PRE[
   mm denotes millimeters, em denotes em units (equal to the height of
   the default font), and px denotes screen pixels. The default units
   are screen pixels (chosen for backwards compatibility). The number is
   an integer value or a real valued number such as "2.5". Exponents, as
   in "1.2e2", are not allowed.  White space is not allowed between the
   number and the suffix.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The above set of suffices is augmented for certain elements: "%" is
   used for the WIDTH attribute for the TABLE element. It indicates that
   the attribute specifies the percentage width of the space between the
   current left and right margins, e.g. width="50%". For the COL
   element, "*" is used with the WIDTH attribute to specify relative
   column widths, e.g. width="3*", using the same representation as the
   CALS table model.

       Note you can use <BR CLEAR=LEFT> after the table element if you
       want to avoid text flowing along side the table when you have

       table. To prevent a right aligned table flowing around something
       else, use <BR CLEAR=RIGHT> before the table etc. Greater control
       over textflow is possible using style sheets.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   WIDTH
       Specifies the desired width of the table. In addition to the
       standard units, the "%" sign may used to indicate that the width
       specifies the percentage width of the space between the current
       left and right margins, e.g. width="50%". In the absence of this
       attribute, the table width can be determined by the layout
       algorithm given later on.
]PRE]

[PRE[
       It is recommended that the table width be increased beyond the
       value indicated by the WIDTH attribute as needed to avoid any
       overflow of cell contents. Such increases should try to avoid
       drastic changes to relative column widths specified by the
       author. To avoid the need for excessive horizontal scrolling, or
       when such scrolling is impractical or undesired, it may be
       appropriate to split words across lines.

   COLS

       user agent may render the table dynamically as data is received
       from the network without waiting for the complete table to be
       received. If the WIDTH attribute is missing, a default of "100%"
       may be assumed for this purpose. If the COLS attribute is

       Note: it would have been preferable to choose values for FRAME
       consistent with the RULES attribute and the values used for
       alignment. For instance: none, top, bottom, topbot, left, right,
       leftright, all. Unfortunately, SGML requires enumerated
       attribute values to be unique for each element, independent of
       the attribute name. This causes immediate problems for "none",
       "left", "right" and "all". The values for FRAME have been chosen
       to avoid clashes with the RULES, ALIGN and VALIGN attributes.

       that that the FRAME and RULES attributes will be added to other

   The COLGROUP element acts as a container for a group of columns, and
   allows you to set default properties for these columns. In the
   absence of a COLGROUP element, all columns in the table are assumed
   to belong to a single column group. Each COLGROUP element can
   contain zero or more COL elements. COLGROUP requires a start tag,
   but the end tag may be omitted. This is useful when defining a
   sequence of COLGROUP elements, e.g.

   SPAN
       A positive integer value that specifies a default for how many

   SPAN
       A positive integer value that specifies how many columns this

       the second COL element to the second column and so on. If the
       second COL element had SPAN=2, it would apply to the second and
       third column. The next COL element would then apply to the
       fourth column and so on. SPAN=0 has a special significance and
       implies that the COL element spans all columns from the current
       column up to and including the last column. Note that a COL SPAN
       does not define a group. It is merely a way to share attribute
       definitions.

   WIDTH
       Specifies the width of the columns, see standard units. If the

   The THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY elements provide a convenient means for

   the body, user agents may choose to use a scrolling region for the
   table body sections. When rendering to a paged device, tables will
   often have to be broken across page boundaries. The THEAD, TFOOT and

   bottom of the current page, and then the table head at the top of
   the new page before continuing on with the table body.

   TFOOT is placed before the TBODY in the markup sequence, so that

Recommended Layout Algorithms

[PRE[
   If the COLS attribute on the TABLE element specifies the number of
   columns, then the table may be rendered using a fixed layout,
   otherwise the autolayout algorithm described below should be used.
]PRE]

Fixed Layout Algorithm

[PRE[
   For this algorithm, it is assumed that the number of columns is
   known. The column widths by default should be set to the same size.
   Authors may override this by specifying relative or absolute column
   widths, using the COLGROUP or COL elements. The default table width
   is the space between the current left and right margins, but may be
   overridden by the WIDTH attribute on the TABLE element, or determined
   from absolute column widths. To deal with mixtures of absolute and
   relative column widths, the first step is to allocate space from the
   table width to columns with absolute widths. After this, the space
   remaining is divided up between the columns with relative widths.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The table syntax alone is insufficient to guarantee the consistency
   of attribute values. For instance, the number of columns specified by
   the COLS attribute may be inconsistent with the number of columns
   implied by the COL elements. This in turn, may be inconsistent with
   the number of columns implied by the table cells. A further problem
   occurs when the columns are too narrow to avoid overflow of cell
   contents. The width of the table as specified by the TABLE element or
   COL elements may result in overflow of cell contents. It is

   In the event that an indivisible element causes cell overflow, the
   user agent may consider adjusting column widths and re-rendering the
   table. In the worst case clipping may be considered if column width
   adjustments and/or scrollable cell content are not feasible. In any
   case if cell content is split or clipped this should be indicated to
   the user in an appropriate manner.

   user agent should use the following autolayout algorithm. It uses two
   passes through the table data and scales linearly with the size of
   the table.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   In the first pass, line wrapping is disabled, and the user agent
   keeps track of the minimum and maximum width of each cell. The
   maximum width is given by the widest line. As line wrap has been
   disabled, paragraphs are treated as long lines unless broken by <BR>
   elements. The minimum width is given by the widest word or image etc.
   taking into account leading indents and list bullets etc. In other
   words, if you were to format the cell's content in a window of its
   own, determine the minimum width you could make the window before the
   cell begins to overflow. Allowing user agents to split words will
   minimize the need for horizontal scrolling or in the worst case
   clipping of cell contents.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This process also applies to any nested tables occuring in cell
   content. The minimum and maximum widths for cells in nested tables
   are used to determine the minimum and maximum widths for these tables
   and hence for the parent table cell itself. The algorithm is linear
   with aggregate cell content, and broadly speaking independent of the
   depth of nesting.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   To cope with character alignment of cell contents, the algorithm
   keeps three running min/max totals for each column: Left of align
   char, right of align char and un-aligned. The minimum width for a
   column is then: max(min_left + min_right, min_non-aligned).
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The minimum and maximum cell widths are then used to determine the
   corresponding minimum and maximum widths for the columns. These in
   turn, are used to find the minimum and maximum width for the table.
   Note that cells can contain nested tables, but this doesn't
   complicate the code significantly. The next step is to assign column
   widths according to the available space (i.e. the space between the

   current left and right margins).
]PRE]

[PRE[
   For cells which span multiple columns, a simple approach, as used by
   Arena, is to evenly apportion the min/max widths to each of the
   constituent columns. A slightly more complex approach is to use the
   min/max widths of unspanned cells to weight how spanned widths are
   apportioned. Experimental study suggests a blend of the two
   approaches will give good results for a wide range of tables.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   The table borders and intercell margins need to be included in
   assigning column widths. There are three cases:
]PRE]

[PRE[
   1.  The minimum table width is equal to or wider than the available
       space. In this case, assign the minimum widths and allow the
       user to scroll horizontally. For conversion to braille, it will
       be necessary to replace the cells by references to notes
       containing their full content. By convention these appear before
       the table.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   2.  The maximum table width fits within the available space. In this
       case, set the columns to their maximum widths.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   3.  The maximum width of the table is greater than the available
       space, but the minimum table width is smaller. In this case,
       find the difference between the available space and the minimum
       table width, lets call it W. Lets also call D the difference
       between maximum and minimum width of the table.
]PRE]

[PRE[
       For each column, let d be the difference between maximum and
       minimum width of that column. Now set the column's width to the
       minimum width plus d times W over D. This makes columns with
       large differences between minimum and maximum widths wider than
       columns with smaller differences.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   This assignment step is then repeated for nested tables using the
   minimum and maximum widths derived for all such tables in the first
   pass. In this case, the width of the parent (i.e. enclosing) table
   cell plays the role of the current window size in the above
   description. This process is repeated recursively for all nested
   tables. The topmost table is then rendered using the assigned widths.
   Nested tables are subsequently rendered as part of the parent table's
   cell contents.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   If the table width is specified with the WIDTH attribute, the user
   agent attempts to set column widths to match. The WIDTH attribute is
   not binding if this results in columns having less than their minimum
   (i.e. indivisible) widths.

]PRE]

[PRE[
   If relative widths are specified with the COL element, the algorithm
   is modified to increase column widths over the minimum width to meet
   the relative width constraints. The COL elements should be taken as
   hints only, so columns shouldn't be set to less than their minimum
   width. Similarly, columns shouldn't be made so wide that the table
   stretches well beyond the extent of the window. If a COL element
   specifies a relative width of zero, the column should always be set
   to its minimum width.
