>Markdoc is a Markdown-based document format and a framework for content publishing. Markdoc extends Markdown with a custom syntax for tags and annotations, providing a way to tailor content to individual users and introduce interactive elements. This specification describes the syntax of Markdoc tags and how to parse them within Markdown content.

>Markdoc syntax is a superset of Markdown, specifically the CommonMark specification. Markdoc adds a few extensions to the syntax, such as tags and annotations, which we describe below. These extensions enable Markdoc's powerful extensibility model.

>Tags are the main syntactic extension that Markdoc adds on top of Markdown. Each tag is enclosed with {% and %}, and includes the tag name, attributes, and the content body.
>
Similar to HTML, you can nest Markdoc tags, and customize them with attributes.
