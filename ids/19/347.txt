]FIGCAPTION]

> The recent ISO8601:201x standard supersedes the draft EDTF (Extended Date Time Format) extensions. Biblatex therefore now supports the ISO8601-2 Clause 4, Level 1 Extended Format which is equivalent to the draft EDTF standard but with different syntax. This syntax is in some cases not backwards compatible. Biblatex will not support backwards compatibility for the draft EDTF syntax because it is too messy to do so and few people were using this anyway since it is a relatively new and specialised feature.
