> This document lays out the design for Model-driven Views (MDV): A proposal for extending HTML and the DOM APIs to support a sensible separation between the UI (DOM) of a document or application and its underlying data (model). Updates to the model are reflected in the DOM and user input into the DOM is immediately assigned to the model.

> Polymer's TemplateBinding library extends the capabilities of the HTML Template Element by enabling it to create, manage, and remove instances of content bound to data defined in JavaScript. Although internal in Polymer, it is also useful standalone.
