[3] [CITE@en[Web Applications 1.0 r8306     People apparently don't like it when the spec requires things that are impossible to implement, go figure. (In this case, synchronously detecting that one of the MessagePorts being Transferred in the MessagePort message is actually the target of the message. You can't necessarily know this synchronously, since if the port has been shunted around between workers, you might only discover who the final target actually is after the message has itself bounced between threads for a while.)]]
