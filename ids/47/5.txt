> ITRANS offers a choice of two input encodings: ITRANS Encoding, and the CS/CSX encoding. ITRANS encoding is a 7-bit ASCII encoding, while the CS/CSX encoding is a 8-bit encoding. The ITRANS encoding requires multi-character English code be used to represent each Indic Script letter, while the CS/CSX encoding uses a one-character code to represent each Indic Script letter. [See ITRANS/doc/icsx.itx in the ITRANS archive for more details regarding CS/CSX.]
>
ITRANS has three kinds of input interfaces: one or TeX documents, one for raw PostScript commands documents, and a third for HTML documents. The TeX interface is available for all languages, while the PostScript interface is available for PostScript fonts only, and the HTML interface is available for PostScript or TrueType fonts only. Currently, the PostScript and HTML interfaces are available for these languages: Devanagari (Xdvng), Bengali (ItxBeng), Gujarati (ItxGuj), and Romanized Sanskrit (CSutopia or Wnri). 

>    [B[Bwti]], a [B[Bengali]] font, and [B[Pun]], a [B[Gurmukhi]] font for Punjabi, added to ITRANS. 

>
Added #endfont=<string> and extended #<langfont>, mainly for ease of use with direct HTML output mode of ITRANS. Usage:
[PRE[
#endfont=</FONT> % this is a global command, for all languages
....
#hindifont=<FONT FACE="Xdvng"> % this is language specific
]PRE]
now, every #hindi will then print <FONT FACE="Xdvng"> & any #end<lang> will print </FONT> 

* [CITE[Itranslator]]

>
Itranslator is a free utility for PCs developed by Omkarananda Ashram Himalayas, which converts ITRANS 5.1 (as well as ITRANS 4) Sanskrit text or text files into Devanagari and Transliteration script (True Type), which can then be exported or pasted via the clipboard to any application. Itranslator produces results that are fully editable, printable on any printer, and of book-quality.
>[SNIP[]]
>Itranslator is not well-suited for Hindi, Marathi and other languages, since it uses ligatures that are not commonly used in those languages, while it lacks some of the characters needed for them. 

>
[B[Sanskrit 98]] (Devanagari) and [B[Translit 98]] (Roman Transliteration)
These are the fonts that go with Itranslator 98 and work well under Windows 98.
>
Users of previous versions of Itranslators can still download: 
[B[Sanskrit New & Sanskrit 1.2]] Fonts (Devanagari, March 98) or
[B[Nina 1.0]] Fonts or [B[Nina 1.2]] Fonts (Roman Transliteration)
