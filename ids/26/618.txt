> For efficient usage of the API, clients should make conditional GET requests whenever possible. If If-Modified-Since-Version: <libraryVersion> is passed with a multi-object read request (e.g., /users/1/items) and data has not changed in the library since the specified version, the API will return 304 Not Modified. Single-object conditional requests are not currently supported, but will be supported in the future.
