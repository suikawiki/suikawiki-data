> Scholarly HTML is four things:
= It’s a movement: committed to bringing scholarship to the web using standard web approaches – ie HTML, and links rather than PDF. Scholarly HTML builds on the ‘Beyond the PDF‘ movement and grew out of the January 2011 meeting in San Diego.
= It’s a format: a ‘profile’ of HTML that sets out conventions for encoding scholarly content in a declarative way using standard approaches such as RDFa and established microformats.
= It’s a a set of tools: to help authors create Scholarly HTML
= Documentation: how-to guides for the above.
> The abbreviated form of the name is ScHTML and people have started pronouncing that Scuml.
