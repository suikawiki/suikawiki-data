Retaining Consecutive Spaces (xfa-spacerun:yes)
>
Normally, an XFA processing application removes consecutive spaces, as described in “White Space
Handling” on page 133; however, this behavior can be overridden in rich text.
>
A run of consecutive normal spaces may be represented via the use of a span element in conjunction with
a nonstandard [CSS2] style attribute xfa-spacerun. An XFA processing application that supports this
feature must interpret each non-breaking-space character within the span as representing a normal space
character (character 32).
>
In order to allow this span element to produce an approximate visual rendering, when processed by a
browser or other [XHTML] processing application, the span element may contain a mixture of
non-breaking-space and normal space characters. While the application that supports this
>
xfa-spacerun style must interpret each non-breaking-space character within the span as representing a
normal space character (character 32), the browser or other [XHTML] processing application will likely
ignore the xfa-spacerun style and provide a rendering that may be visually similar.
