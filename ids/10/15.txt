[3] Algorithm for Converting Gregorian Dates to ISO 8601 Week Date


[4] [CITE@en[Web Applications 1.0 r7334 Mention ISO 8601 in the 'week' section. This is a note, since it's non-normative but the statement could be confused as normative if it wasn't made a note. Also, it's qualified, because I'm not sure it's 100% true for dates before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (it's proleptic, but I can't find any evidence that ISO8601's weeks are too, and wikipedia says ISO8601 isn't proleptic in general unless you have prior agreement as we do here). Also, it's different from the recent edit to the W3C spec for the same issue because the W3C one breaks the editorial convention used in this spec that avoids having references in sentences. Wow that's a long checkin comment for such a minor issue.]]
