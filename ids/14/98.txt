This part of ISO/IEC 19757 uses EBNF notation to describe the full syntax and the simple syntax of RELAX NG. A
description of a grammar in EBNF consists of one or more production rules. Each production rule consists of the
name of a non-terminal, followed by ::=, followed by a list of alternatives separated by |. Within an alternative,
italic type is used to reference a non-terminal, concatenation indicates sequencing, [] indicates optionality, +
indicates repetition one or more times and * indicates repetition zero or more times; other characters in normal
type stand for themselves.
