> This document uses a R-BNF notation, which is a mix of Extended BNF and PCRE-style regular expressions:
> Rules are in the form: name = definition. Rule names referenced as-is in the definition. Angle brackets may be used to help facilitate discerning the use of rule names.
> Literals are surrounded by quotation marks: "literal".
> Sequences: (rule1 rule2) or simply rule1 rule2.
> Alternatives groups: (rule1 | rule2).
> Optional groups: '''['''rule'''['''''']'''''']'''.
> Repetition: rule* means 0 or more of this rule or this group.
> Repetition: rule+ means 1 or more of this rule or this group.
