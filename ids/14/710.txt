Work around a bug in Netscape Navigator versions 2.x, 3.x and 4.0b2's
parsing of headers.  If the terminating empty-line CRLF occurs starting
at the 256th or 257th byte of output, then Navigator will think a normal
image is invalid.  We are guessing that this is because their initial
read of a new request uses a 256 byte buffer. We check the bytes written
so far and, if we are about to tickle the bug, we instead insert a
padding header of eminent bogosity.
