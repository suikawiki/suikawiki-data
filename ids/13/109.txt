>[I[Techniques for Using SGML]] (ISO TR 9573) is being revised to add some new parts and to merge informative material that has been carried as parts of other projects. The part on public entities for mathematical and scientific publishing (including material that was in the annexes to ISO 8879) has already been published as Part 13. The part that documents the SGML-based system used by ISO Central Secretariat to produce texts of standards has also been published as Part 11. Another part on public entities for non-Latin alphabets has been balloted as Part 15 and ballot responses are being considered. A part on Using SGML for Computer to Computer Interchange (Notation Declarations for Data Encoding Standards) has been balloted as Part 9, and a final text is being prepared. The proposed Parts 1--6, tutorials on the SGML language and basic techniques, have been deferred completion of the revision process for ISO 8879:1986.
