>The BlackBerry Browser can create links that can integrate with other BlackBerry device applications. When the BlackBerry
Browser renders the content, it scans the content for patterns that appear to be telephone numbers or email addresses, and
creates links that will open the phone or email application. If necessary, you can override this behavior by adding the following
meta tag to your document:
><meta http-equiv="x-rim-auto-match" content="none">
