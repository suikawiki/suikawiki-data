> client
>       The application entity that initiates a TLS connection to a
>       server.  This may or may not imply that the client initiated the
>       underlying transport connection.  The primary operational
>       difference between the server and client is that the server is
>       generally authenticated, while the client is only optionally
>       authenticated.
