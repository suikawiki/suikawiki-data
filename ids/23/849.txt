> client
>       The application entity that initiates a TLS connection to a
>       server.  This may or may not imply that the client initiated the
>       underlying transport connection.  The primary operational
>       difference between the server and client is that the server is
>       generally authenticated, while the client is only optionally
>       authenticated.

> TLS client:  An entity that assumes the role of a client in a
>       Transport Layer Security '''['''TLS''']''' negotiation.  In this specification
>       we generally assume that the TLS client is an (interactive or
>       automated) application client; however, in application protocols
>       that enable server-to-server communication, the TLS client could
>       be a peer application service.
