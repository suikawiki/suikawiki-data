> Yahoo!'s OAuth implementation is fully compliant with OAuth Core 1.0 and the OAuth Session Extension draft (1). In order to support OAuth in a scalable way, Yahoo! proposed and helped create the OAuth Session Extension together with AOL and Google. The extension is currently being added to all the major OAuth client libraries as well as the Y!OS SDK.
