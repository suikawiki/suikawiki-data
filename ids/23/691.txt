> The parameter named oauth_problem_advice consists of free-form text to be shown to the User. It SHOULD describe the problem in a way that's meaningful to the User, and suggest how to resolve the problem. The Consumer MUST NOT interpret it as HTML or any other markup language; all the characters MUST be displayed to the user. To indicate a line break, the single character LF (Unicode U+000A) MUST be used.
