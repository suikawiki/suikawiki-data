> When a versioned resource is checked out and then subsequently checked in, the version that was checked out becomes a "predecessor" of the version created by the checkin.  A client can specify multiple predecessors for a new version if the new version is logically a merge of those predecessors.  The inverse of the predecessor relation is the "successor" relation.  Therefore, if X is a predecessor of Y, then Y is a successor of X.
