> Enter the most excellent suggestion from Tim Pope. Using DNS to solve this problem means no more hassle! He set up a localhost wildcard, pointing *.smackaho.st at 127.0.0.1. Essentially this means that '''['''anything''']'''.smackaho.st will point to your local machine. Not happy with smackaho.st? lvh.me does the same thing (lvh, as in local virtual host).

> One good solution is offered by Tim Pope on his blog. He has bought the domain name smackaho.st and made it a localhost wildcard. One of the people who commented on that blog posting has sone something similar with a shorter domain name, lvh.me, and we’re going to use that instead.
