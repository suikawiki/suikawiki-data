> When the subjectAltName extension contains a URI, the name MUST be
>    stored in the uniformResourceIdentifier (an IA5String).  The name
>    MUST NOT be a relative URI, and it MUST follow the URI syntax and
>    encoding rules specified in '''['''RFC3986''']'''.  The name MUST include both a
>    scheme (e.g., "http" or "ftp") and a scheme-specific-part.  URIs that
>    include an authority ('''['''RFC3986''']''', Section 3.2) MUST include a fully
>    qualified domain name or IP address as the host.  Rules for encoding
>    Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) are specified in
>    Section 7.4.

> For URIs, the constraint applies to the host part of the name.  The
>    constraint MUST be specified as a fully qualified domain name and MAY
>    specify a host or a domain.  Examples would be "host.example.com" and
>    ".example.com".  When the constraint begins with a period, it MAY be
>    expanded with one or more labels.  That is, the constraint
>    ".example.com" is satisfied by both host.example.com and
>    my.host.example.com.  However, the constraint ".example.com" is not
>    satisfied by "example.com".  When the constraint does not begin with
>    a period, it specifies a host.  If a constraint is applied to the
>    uniformResourceIdentifier name form and a subsequent certificate
>    includes a subjectAltName extension with a uniformResourceIdentifier
>    that does not include an authority component with a host name
>    specified as a fully qualified domain name (e.g., if the URI either
>    does not include an authority component or includes an authority
>    component in which the host name is specified as an IP address), then
>    the application MUST reject the certificate.
