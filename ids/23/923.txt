> When the subjectAltName extension contains a URI, the name MUST be
>    stored in the uniformResourceIdentifier (an IA5String).  The name
>    MUST NOT be a relative URI, and it MUST follow the URI syntax and
>    encoding rules specified in '''['''RFC3986''']'''.  The name MUST include both a
>    scheme (e.g., "http" or "ftp") and a scheme-specific-part.  URIs that
>    include an authority ('''['''RFC3986''']''', Section 3.2) MUST include a fully
>    qualified domain name or IP address as the host.  Rules for encoding
>    Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) are specified in
>    Section 7.4.
