> When the subjectAltName extension contains a URI, the name MUST be
>    stored in the uniformResourceIdentifier (an IA5String).  The name
>    MUST NOT be a relative URI, and it MUST follow the URI syntax and
>    encoding rules specified in '''['''RFC3986''']'''.  The name MUST include both a
>    scheme (e.g., "http" or "ftp") and a scheme-specific-part.  URIs that
>    include an authority ('''['''RFC3986''']''', Section 3.2) MUST include a fully
>    qualified domain name or IP address as the host.  Rules for encoding
>    Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) are specified in
>    Section 7.4.

> For URIs, the constraint applies to the host part of the name.  The
>    constraint MUST be specified as a fully qualified domain name and MAY
>    specify a host or a domain.  Examples would be "host.example.com" and
>    ".example.com".  When the constraint begins with a period, it MAY be
>    expanded with one or more labels.  That is, the constraint
>    ".example.com" is satisfied by both host.example.com and
>    my.host.example.com.  However, the constraint ".example.com" is not
>    satisfied by "example.com".  When the constraint does not begin with
>    a period, it specifies a host.  If a constraint is applied to the
>    uniformResourceIdentifier name form and a subsequent certificate
>    includes a subjectAltName extension with a uniformResourceIdentifier
>    that does not include an authority component with a host name
>    specified as a fully qualified domain name (e.g., if the URI either
>    does not include an authority component or includes an authority
>    component in which the host name is specified as an IP address), then
>    the application MUST reject the certificate.

> To accommodate IRIs in the current structure, conforming
>    implementations MUST map IRIs to URIs as specified in Section 3.1 of
>    '''['''RFC3987''']''', with the following clarifications:
>       *  in step 1, generate a UCS character sequence from the original
>          IRI format normalizing according to the NFC as specified in
>          Variant b (normalization according to NFC);
>       *  perform step 2 using the output from step 1.
>    Implementations MUST NOT convert the ireg-name component before
>    performing step 2.
>    Before URIs may be compared, conforming implementations MUST perform
>    a combination of the syntax-based and scheme-based normalization
>    techniques described in '''['''RFC3987''']'''.  Specifically, conforming
>    implementations MUST prepare URIs for comparison as follows:
>       *  Step 1: Where IRIs allow the usage of IDNs, those names MUST be
>          converted to ASCII Compatible Encoding as specified in Section
>          7.2 above.
>       *  Step 2: The scheme and host are normalized to lowercase, as
>          described in Section 5.3.2.1 of '''['''RFC3987''']'''.
>       *  Step 3: Perform percent-encoding normalization, as specified in
>          Section 5.3.2.3 of '''['''RFC3987''']'''.
>       *  Step 4: Perform path segment normalization, as specified in
>          Section 5.3.2.4 of '''['''RFC3987''']'''.
>       *  Step 5: If recognized, the implementation MUST perform scheme-
>          based normalization as specified in Section 5.3.3 of '''['''RFC3987''']'''.
>    Conforming implementations MUST recognize and perform scheme-based
>    normalization for the following schemes: ldap, http, https, and ftp.
>    If the scheme is not recognized, step 5 is omitted.
>    When comparing URIs for equivalence, conforming implementations shall
>    perform a case-sensitive exact match.
>    Implementations should convert URIs to Unicode before display.
>    Specifically, conforming implementations should perform the
>    conversion operation specified in Section 3.2 of '''['''RFC3987''']'''.
