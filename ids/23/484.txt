> Structured text (Stx) is a kind of plaintext with unambiguous markup for formatting constructs. It is designed to adhere to the tradition and readability of plaintext, with _emphasis_ marked by underscores, paragraph breaks by empty lines, and so on.
> Stx is meant to be as good an authoring format as possible. It combines the benefits of structured markup (mid-level semantic markup such as DocBook or HTML) with the ease and readability of plaintext.
