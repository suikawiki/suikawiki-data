> To make Speed Dial content more dynamic, you can define an autoreloading behavior that will be used if the user adds the site to a Speed Dial slot. You can set this in two ways:
> Using a meta tag:
> <meta http-equiv="preview-refresh" content="3600">
> Setting Preview-Refresh as a response header:
> Preview-Refresh:3600
> Note that the value is set in seconds. 3600 will thus reload the Speed Dial entry every hour.
