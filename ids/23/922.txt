> When the subjectAltName extension contains a domain name system
>    label, the domain name MUST be stored in the dNSName (an IA5String).
>    The name MUST be in the "preferred name syntax", as specified by
>    Section 3.5 of '''['''RFC1034''']''' and as modified by Section 2.1 of
>    '''['''RFC1123''']'''.  Note that while uppercase and lowercase letters are
>    allowed in domain names, no significance is attached to the case.  In
>    addition, while the string " " is a legal domain name, subjectAltName
>    extensions with a dNSName of " " MUST NOT be used.  Finally, the use
>    of the DNS representation for Internet mail addresses
>    (subscriber.example.com instead of subscriber@example.com) MUST NOT
>    be used; such identities are to be encoded as rfc822Name.

> the semantics of subject alternative names that include
>    wildcard characters (e.g., as a placeholder for a set of names) are
>    not addressed by this specification.  Applications with specific
>    requirements MAY use such names, but they must define the semantics.

> DNS name restrictions are expressed as host.example.com.  Any DNS
>    name that can be constructed by simply adding zero or more labels to
>    the left-hand side of the name satisfies the name constraint.  For
>    example, www.host.example.com would satisfy the constraint but
>    host1.example.com would not.
