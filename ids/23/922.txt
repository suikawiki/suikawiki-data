> When the subjectAltName extension contains a domain name system
>    label, the domain name MUST be stored in the dNSName (an IA5String).
>    The name MUST be in the "preferred name syntax", as specified by
>    Section 3.5 of '''['''RFC1034''']''' and as modified by Section 2.1 of
>    '''['''RFC1123''']'''.  Note that while uppercase and lowercase letters are
>    allowed in domain names, no significance is attached to the case.  In
>    addition, while the string " " is a legal domain name, subjectAltName
>    extensions with a dNSName of " " MUST NOT be used.  Finally, the use
>    of the DNS representation for Internet mail addresses
>    (subscriber.example.com instead of subscriber@example.com) MUST NOT
>    be used; such identities are to be encoded as rfc822Name.
