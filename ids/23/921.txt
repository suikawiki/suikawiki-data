> A name constraint for Internet mail addresses MAY specify a
>    particular mailbox, all addresses at a particular host, or all
>    mailboxes in a domain.  To indicate a particular mailbox, the
>    constraint is the complete mail address.  For example,
>    "root@example.com" indicates the root mailbox on the host
>    "example.com".  To indicate all Internet mail addresses on a
>    particular host, the constraint is specified as the host name.  For
>    example, the constraint "example.com" is satisfied by any mail
>    address at the host "example.com".  To specify any address within a
>    domain, the constraint is specified with a leading period (as with
>    URIs).  For example, ".example.com" indicates all the Internet mail
>    addresses in the domain "example.com", but not Internet mail
>    addresses on the host "example.com".

> Where the host-part (the Domain of the Mailbox) contains an
>    internationalized name, the domain name MUST be converted from an IDN
>    to the ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) format as specified in Section
>    7.2.
>    Two email addresses are considered to match if:
>       1)  the local-part of each name is an exact match, AND
>       2)  the host-part of each name matches using a case-insensitive
>           ASCII comparison.
>    Implementations should convert the host-part of internationalized
>    email addresses specified in these extensions to Unicode before
>    display.  Specifically, conforming implementations should perform the
>    conversion of the host-part of the Mailbox as described in Section
>    7.2.
