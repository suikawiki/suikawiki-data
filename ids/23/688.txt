> The parameter named oauth_acceptable_timestamps consists of two numbers in decimal notation, separated by '-' (hyphen). It's the range of timestamps acceptable to the sender. That is, it means the sender will currently accept an oauth_timestamp that's not less than the first number and not greater than the second number.
