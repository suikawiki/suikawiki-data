> Registration Authority (RA): Any Legal Entity that is responsible for identification and authentication of subjects
> of Certificates, but is not a CA, and hence does not sign or issue Certificates. An RA may assist in the certificate
> application process or revocation process or both. When “RA” is used as an adjective to describe a role or function,
> it does not necessarily imply a separate body, but can be part of the CA.
