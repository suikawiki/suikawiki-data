>  Legacy implementations exist where an electronic mail address is
>    embedded in the subject distinguished name as an emailAddress
>    attribute '''['''RFC2985''']'''.  The attribute value for emailAddress is of type
>    IA5String to permit inclusion of the character '@', which is not part
>    of the PrintableString character set.  emailAddress attribute values
>    are not case-sensitive (e.g., "subscriber@example.com" is the same as
>    "SUBSCRIBER@EXAMPLE.COM").
>    Conforming implementations generating new certificates with
>    electronic mail addresses MUST use the rfc822Name in the subject
>    alternative name extension (Section 4.2.1.6) to describe such
>    identities.  Simultaneous inclusion of the emailAddress attribute in
>    the subject distinguished name to support legacy implementations is
>    deprecated but permitted.
