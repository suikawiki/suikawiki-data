> delegated domain:  A domain name or host name that is explicitly
>       configured for communicating with the source domain, by either (a)
>       the human user controlling an interactive client or (b) a trusted
>       administrator.  In case (a), one example of delegation is an
>       account setup that specifies the domain name of a particular host
>       to be used for retrieving information or connecting to a network,
>       which might be different from the server portion of the user's
>       account name (e.g., a server at mailhost.example.com for
>       connecting to an IMAP server hosting an email address of
>       juliet@example.com).  In case (b), one example of delegation is an
>       admin-configured host-to-address/address-to-host lookup table.
