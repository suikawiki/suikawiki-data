> source domain:  The fully qualified DNS domain name that a client
>       expects an application service to present in the certificate
>       (e.g., "www.example.com"), typically input by a human user,
>       configured into a client, or provided by reference such as in a
>       hyperlink.  The combination of a source domain and, optionally, an
>       application service type enables a client to construct one or more
>       reference identifiers.
