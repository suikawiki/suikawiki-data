> The manner in which Web standards are developed today is often daunting to newcomers, most notably to Web developers whose input is sorely needed in order to build a better Web.
> The goal of this project is to fix this. The Web development community, and open source people in general, have over time developed work modes that are highly effective and can sustain both high quality and openness to contributions. There is no reason why such methods cannot be applied to open standards just as well, and that is what we endeavour to do.
