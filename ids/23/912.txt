>  In addition, implementations of this specification MUST be prepared
>    to receive the domainComponent attribute, as defined in '''['''RFC4519''']'''.
>    The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a hierarchical resource
>    labeling system.  This attribute provides a convenient mechanism for
>    organizations that wish to use DNs that parallel their DNS names.
>    This is not a replacement for the dNSName component of the
>    alternative name extensions.  Implementations are not required to
>    convert such names into DNS names.  The syntax and associated OID for
>    this attribute type are provided in the ASN.1 modules in Appendix A.
>    Rules for encoding internationalized domain names for use with the
>    domainComponent attribute type are specified in Section 7.3.
