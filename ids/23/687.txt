> The parameter named oauth_acceptable_versions consists of two version numbers separated by '-' (hyphen). It's the range of versions acceptable to the sender. That is, it means the sender will currently accept an oauth_version that's not less than the first number and not greater than the second number. A version A.B is considered greater than C.D if either A > C, or A = C and B > D.
