>  If the host name is discovered indirectly and in an insecure manner
>    (e.g., by an insecure DNS query for an MX or SRV record), it SHOULD
>    NOT be used as a reference identifier '''['''RFC6125''']''' even when it matches
>    the presented certificate.  This proviso does not apply if the host
>    name is discovered securely (for further discussion, see '''['''DANE-SRV''']'''
>    and '''['''DANE-SMTP''']''').
