> 
>    user-agent-based application
>       A user-agent-based application is a public client in which the
>       client code is downloaded from a web server and executes within a
>       user-agent (e.g., web browser) on the device used by the resource
>       owner.  Protocol data and credentials are easily accessible (and
>       often visible) to the resource owner.  Since such applications
>       reside within the user-agent, they can make seamless use of the
>       user-agent capabilities when requesting authorization.
