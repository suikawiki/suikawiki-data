> 
>    native application
>       A native application is a public client installed and executed on
>       the device used by the resource owner.  Protocol data and
>       credentials are accessible to the resource owner.  It is assumed
>       that any client authentication credentials included in the
>       application can be extracted.  On the other hand, dynamically
>       issued credentials such as access tokens or refresh tokens can
>       receive an acceptable level of protection.  At a minimum, these
>       credentials are protected from hostile servers with which the
>       application may interact.  On some platforms, these credentials
>       might be protected from other applications residing on the same
>       device.
