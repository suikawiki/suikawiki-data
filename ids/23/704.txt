> A modhash is a token that the reddit API requires to help prevent CSRF. Modhashes can be obtained via the /api/me.json call or in response data of listing endpoints.
> The preferred way to send a modhash is to include an X-Modhash custom HTTP header with your requests.
> Modhashes are not required when authenticated with OAuth.
