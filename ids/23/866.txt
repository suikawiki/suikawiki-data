> When crawling URLs for App Link metadata, developers should send a request with al as one of the prefix values for the Prefer-Html-Meta-Tags header. Your server may choose to limit its response to only include HTML containing the tags above, and can use this as a signal to return these tags even when the response type for the given location would otherwise be something other than text/html.
> Prefer-Html-Meta-Tags: al
