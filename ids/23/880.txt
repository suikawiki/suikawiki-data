> PSM is a code module in the Mozilla platform. Formerly PSM meant "personal security manager", because it was implemented as a separate program. Things have changed long ago, the code is now an internal code module. Encryption technologies (such as SSL and PKI in general) have become a mandatory part of the Mozilla applications.
> The PSM acronym may also be described as "Platform Security Module".
> (As a reminder, PSM is internal glue code that connects the Mozilla platform code to the external NSS libraries. It's NSS that contains the general purpose implementations for core security protocols, algorithms and much more.
