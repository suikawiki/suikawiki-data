> 4.2.1.6 LDP servers must publish any constraints on LDP clients’ ability to create or update LDPRs, by adding a Link header with an appropriate context URI, a link relation of http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#constrainedBy, and a target URI identifying a set of constraints '''['''RFC5988''']''', to all responses to requests that fail due to violation of those constraints.

> Containers for related resources must support the same HTTP methods as described above for the Annotation Container, and must support identifying their type with a Link header. The constrainedBy link header on the response when dereferencing the Container should refer to a server specific set of constraints listing the types of content that are acceptable.
