> Specifications get added to this document through pull requests. If you wish to publish a fork of an existing specification, simply add an entry to the <script type="application/webspec+json"> block you will find in the source. The key to the object is structured as username/reponame#branch, and its value is an object with at least a description key. Keep it short and simple; as well as respectful of the other forks.
