> The parameter named oauth_parameters_rejected consists of a set of parameters, encoded as they would be in a URL query string. These are parameters that the sender recently received but didn't expect. Note that these parameters will be percent-encoded twice: once to form a query string and again because the query string is the value of oauth_parameters_rejected.
