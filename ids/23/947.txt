> pinning:  The act of establishing a cached name association between
>       the application service's certificate and one of the client's
>       reference identifiers, despite the fact that none of the presented
>       identifiers matches the given reference identifier.  Pinning is
>       accomplished by allowing a human user to positively accept the
>       mismatch during an attempt to communicate with the application
>       service.  Once a cached name association is established, the
>       certificate is said to be pinned to the reference identifier and
>       in future communication attempts the client simply verifies that
>       the service's presented certificate matches the pinned
>       certificate, as described under Section 6.6.2.  (A similar
>       definition of "pinning" is provided in '''['''WSC-UI''']'''.)
