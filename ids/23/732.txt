]FIGCAPTION]

> The ProxyMaxForwards directive specifies the maximum number of proxies through which a request may pass, if there's no Max-Forwards header supplied with the request. This may be set to prevent infinite proxy loops, or a DoS attack.
> Example
> ProxyMaxForwards 15
> Note that setting ProxyMaxForwards is a violation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol (RFC2616), which forbids a Proxy setting Max-Forwards if the Client didn't set it. Earlier Apache httpd versions would always set it. A negative ProxyMaxForwards value, including the default -1, gives you protocol-compliant behaviour, but may leave you open to loops.
