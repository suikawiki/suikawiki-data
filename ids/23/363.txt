> When a resource is put under version control, it becomes a
"versioned resource".  Many servers protect versioned resources
from modifications by considering them "checked in", and by
requiring a "checkout" operation before modification, and a
"checkin" operation to get back to the "checked-in" state.  Other
servers allow modification, in which case the checkout/checkin
operation may happen implicitly.
