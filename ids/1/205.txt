Hi Jonathan!

I just wanted to let you know that I have settled in my new
offices at the Exobiology Lab at the Interplanetary Space
Exploration Agency's base here on Mars. The trip out was
uneventful and did let me get through an awful lot of
reading in preparation for my three year term here. There
is an excellent library of material here at the lab and
reasonable communications back home, thanks to the CommRing
satellites that were put up last year here. The transfer
rates are only a few terabits per second, but this is
usually adequate for the most part.

私は、火星の惑星間宇宙探検機関の基地の宇宙生物研の
新しい事務所に入植したことをお知らせしたいと思っていました。
この旅は平穏無事で、ここでの3年間の準備でとっても沢山の
読書をしていました。この研究所には素晴らしい資料図書館
がありますし、家と合理的な通信ができまして、
昨年ここに打ち上げられた CommRing 衛星に感謝しないといけません。
転送率は毎秒ほんの数テラビットですが、大体の用には十分です。

We've been doing some simulation work to test various
theories of bio-history on Mars and I have attached the
output of one of the more interesting runs. The results are
best viewed with a model VR-95HR/OS headset with the
peripheral glove adapter. I would recommend finding an
outdoor location if you activate the olfactory simulator
since some of the outputs are pretty rank! You'll notice
that atmospheric outgassing seriously interfered with any
potential complex life form development.

私達は火星生物史の様々な学説を確かめるシミュレーション作業をしていまして、
とても興味深い実験のうちの一つの結果を一緒に送ります。
この結果は付属手袋アダプタをつけた VR-95HR/OS 型ヘッドホンで
観るのが一番です。嗅覚シミュレーターを使うなら、
とっても激しいのもありましたから野外の適当な場所を探した方が
いいと思いますよ。大気が失われたことが複雑な生命体の発達の
大きな支障となったのがお分かり頂けると思います。

We tried a few runs to see what would happen if an
atmospheric confinement/replenishment system had been in
place, but the results are too speculative to be more than
entertaining at this point. There has been some serious
discussion of terra-forming options, but the economics are
still very unclear, as are the time-frames for realizing
any useful results.

私達は大気の生成/補給系があったらどうなるかをみるための
実験も何度か試みましたが、結果は推測によるものが大きく、
この点で楽しむ以上のことはできません。土壌形成条件についての
重大な問題も幾つかあるのですが、経済状態は
有用な結果に気付く時間構造と同様、まだ非常に不明確なのです。

I have also been trying out some new exercises to recover
from the effects of the long trip out. I've attached a
sample neuroscan clip which will give you some feeling for
the kinds of gymnastics that are possible in this gravity
field. My timing is still pretty lousy, but I hope it will
improve with practice.

私は長旅の影響から回復するための新しい運動も試しています。
神経状態片の例を同封しますが、これを使えば
こちらの重力圏内で可能な体操の感覚を味わうことができると思います。
時差ボケでまだおかしいのですけど、段々良くなればいいなあと思っています。

I'd appreciate it very much if you could track down the
latest NanoConstructor ToolKit from MIT. I have need of
some lab gear which isn't available here and which would be
a lot easier to fabricate with the tool kit. The version I
have is NTK-R5 (2020) and I know there has been a lot added
since then.

そちらで最新の NanoConstructor ToolKit が MIT から手に入れば
いいですね。私の方ではこちらで手に入らない実験装置が幾つか
必要で、それがあればツールキットがもっと簡単に組み立てられるのですけど。
私が持ってるのは NTK-R5 (2020) 版ですけど、その後のロットがあるようです。

Therese,

I wanted you to see the simulation runs, too. You may be
able to coax better results from the EXAFLOP array at CERN,
if you still have an account there. We're still limping
along with the 50 PFLOP system that Danny Hillis donated to
the agency a few years back.

私はあなたにシミュレーションしているところもみてもらいたいと思っています。
もしまだ CERN のアカウントを持っているのなら、
そこの EXAFLOP 配列の同軸ケーブルでよりよい結果が出るかもしれません。
私達は数年前に Danny Hillis が寄付してくれた 50 PFLOP 系
でもたもたやってます。

The attached HD video clip shows the greenhouse efforts
here to grow grapes from the cuttings that were brought out
five years ago. We're still a long ways from '82
Beaucastel!

同封の HD ビデオ片は、5年前に持って来た切り枝から葡萄を栽培する
温室の成果が映っています。私達はまだ82年からの長い道のりの
途中にいます。 Beaucastel!

Gotta get ready for a sampling trip to Olympus Mons, so
will send this off for now.

オリンパス山へのサンプリング旅行の準備があるので、
この辺でこの手紙を送ります。

Warmest regards,

それでは。

David,

Many thanks for your note and all its news and interesting
data! Melanie and I are glad to know you are settled now
and back at work. We've been making heavy use of the new
darkside reflector telescope and, thanks to the new petabit
fiber links that were introduced last year, we have very
effective controls from Luna City. We've been able to run
some really interesting synthetic aperture observations by
linking the results from the darkside array and the Earth-
orbiting telescopes, giving us an effective diameter of
about 200,000 miles. I can hardly wait to see what we can
make of some of the most distant Quasars with this set-up.

メモと興味深いデータを送ってくれてどうもありがとう。
君が無事入植して仕事に復帰したのを知って僕も Melanie も
喜んでます。僕達は新しい裏側反射望遠鏡を重宝していて、
それと昨年できた新しいペタビット・ファイバーのリンクの
おかげで月面都市からも随分良く制御できるんです。僕達は
裏側複合望遠鏡と地球軌道望遠鏡の結果と合わせることで、
実質約直径20万マイルの本当に面白い合成開口観察ができています。
この設備で最遠のクエーサーを幾つも発見できるのが待ち遠しいです。

We had quite a scare last month when Melanie complained of
a recurring vertigo. None of the usual treatments seemed to
help so a molecular-level brain bioscan was done. An
unexpectedly high level of localized neuro-transmitter
synthesis was discovered but has now been corrected by
auto-gene therapy.

先月 Melanie が何度も目眩がするというのでおっかないです。
普通の治療では良くならないので、分子水準の脳生体検査をしました。
異常に高い水準の局部神経伝送物質の硬直が見られましたが、
今は自動遺伝子療法で正常になりました。

As you requested, I have attached the latest
NanoConstructor ToolKit from MIT.  This version integrates
the Knowbot control subsystem which allows the NanoSystem
to be fully linked to the Internet for control, data
sharing and inter-system communication. By the way, the
Internet Society has negotiated a nice discount for nano-
fab services if you need something more elaborate than the
ISEA folks have available at XOB. I could put the
NanoSystem on the Solex Mars/Luna run and have it to you
pretty quickly.

それから仰せの通り、 MIT から最新の NanoConstructor ToolKit 
を入手しました。この版では NanoSystem が制御・データ共有・システム間通信のために
完全に Internet に接続する Knowbot 制御下位組織が統合されました。
ところで、 ISEA の連中が XOB で使っているのより精巧な
なのファイバーサービスが必要だったら、 Internet Society が
手頃な値段で譲ってくれますよ。僕は Solex Mars/Luna に
NanoSystem を入れることができました。

Keep in touch!

お返事待ってます。

Jon and Melanie

Bon Jour, David!

こんにちは、 David!

I am writing to you from the Hyatt Geosync where your email
was forwarded to me from INRIA. Louis and I are here
vacationing for two weeks. I have some time available and
will set up a simulation run on my EXAFLOP account. They
have the VR-95HR/OS headsets here for entertainment
purposes, but they will work fine for examining the results
of the simulation.

私は INRIA から電子メイルが転送されてきた Hyatt Geosync 
からあなたに手紙を書いています。 Louis と私はここで
2週間の休暇をとっています。少し時間があるので EXAFLOP の自分の
アカウントでシミュレーションを走らせます。
娯楽用の VR-95HR/OS ヘッドホンがこちらにあるのですが、m
シミュレーション結果の観察には問題ないと思います。

I have been taking time to do some research on the
development of the Interplanetary Internet and have found
some rather interesting results. I guess this counts as a
kind of paleo-networking effort, since some of the early
days reach back to the 1960s. It's hard to believe that
anyone even knew what a computer network was back then!

私は惑星間 Internet の開発の研究をしていて、
ちょっと面白い結果が出ました。これは paleo-ネットワーク効果だと
推測します。というのも早い日々は1960年代にも遡るのです。
誰もが計算機網とは何かを知っているとは思えないような時代ですよ!

Did you know that the original work on Internet was
intended for military network use? One would never guess it
from the current state of affairs, but a lot of the
original packet switching work on ARPANET was done under
the sponsorship of something called the Advanced Research
Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense back in
1968. During the 1970s, a number of packet networks were
built by ARPA and others (including work by the predecessor
to INRIA, IRIA, which developed a packet network called
CIGALE on which the CYCLADES network operating system was
built).  There was also work done by the French PTT on an
experimental system called RCP that later became a
commercial system called TRANSPAC. Some seminal work was
done in the mid-late 1960s in England at the National
Physical Laboratory on a single node switch that apparently
served as the first local area network! It's very hard to
believe that this all happened over 50 years ago.

Internet の初期の作業が軍部のネットワーク使用を目的としたものだったと
ご存知ですか? 今の状況からは想像もつかないでしょうが、
当初の ARPANET のパケット切り替え業は合衆国国防省の Advanced Research
Projects Agency (高度研究計画局) の援助の元で 1968 年に行われました。
1970年代には、幾つものパケット網が ARPA や他の団体 (INRIA
の前進である, CYCLADES ネットワーク制御系が載せられていた CIGALE という
パケット網を開発していた IRIA の作業を含む) により敷かれていました。
また、 RCP という後に TRANSPAC と呼ばれる商用系になる
実験系で French PTT の作業が行われました。元になる作業として
1960年代中後期にイングランドの国立物理研究所 (National
Physical Laboratory) で、最初の局部地域網として
単一ノードスイッチの作業が行われました。これが全て50年前に
起こったことだとはとても信じられないです。

A radio-based network was developed in the same 1960s/early
1970s time period called ALOHANET which featured use of a
randomly-shared radio channel. This idea was later realized
on a coaxial cable at XEROX PARC and called Ethernet. By
1978, the Internet research effort had produced 4 versions
of a set of protocols called "TCP/IP" (Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol"). These were used in
conjunction with devices called gateways, back then, but
which became known as "routers". The gateways connected
packet networks to each other.  The combination of gateways
and TCP/IP software was implemented on a lot of different
operating systems, especially something called UNIX. There
was enough confidence in the resulting implementations that
all the computers on the ARPANET and any networks linked to
the ARPANET by gateways were required to switch over to use
TCP/IP at the beginning of 1983. For many historians, 1983
marks the start of global Internet growth although it had
its origins in the research effort started at Stanford
University in 1973, ten years earlier.

[PRE[
   I am going to read more about this and, if you are
   interested, I can report on what happened after 1983.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   I will leave any simulation results from the EXAFLOP runs
   in the private access directory in the CERN TERAFLEX
   archive.  It will be accessible using the JIT-ticket I have
   attached, protected with your public key.

   Yes, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) set up 5
   super computer centers around the US and also provided some
   seed funding for what they called "intermediate level"
   packet networks which were, in turn, connected to a
   national backbone network they called "NSFNET." The
   intermediate level nets connected the user community
   networks (mostly in research labs and universities at that
   time) to the backbone to which the super computer sites
   were linked. According to my notes, NSF planned to reduce
   funding for the various networking activities over time on
   the presumption that they could become self-sustaining.
   Many of the intermediate level networks sought to create a
   larger market by turning to industry, which NSF permitted.
   There was a rapid growth in the equipment market during the
   last half of the 1980s, for routers (the new name for
   gateways), work stations, network servers, and local area
   networks.  The penetration of the equipment market led to a
   new market in commercial Internet services. Some of the
   intermediate networks became commercial services, joining
   others that were created to meet a growing demand for
   Internet access.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   By mid-1993, the system had grown to include over 15,000
   networks, world-wide, and over 2 million computers. They
   must have thought this was a pretty big system, back then.
   Actually, it was, at the time, the largest collection of
   networks and computers ever interconnected. Looking back
   from our perspective, though, this sounds like a very
   modest beginning, doesn't it? Nobody knew, at the time,
   just how many users there were, but the system was doubling
   annually and that attracted a lot of attention in many
   different quarters.

   I sent a few Knowbot programs out looking for Internet

   1962! This stuff gets addicting after a while.

   Postel apparently edited a series of reports called

   one of the principal means by which the technology of the

   tell, a lot of its culture. The Institute also has a
   phenomenal archive of electronic mail going back to about
   1970 (do you believe it? Email from over 50 years ago!). I
   don't have time to set up a really good automatic analysis
   of the contents, but I did leave a couple of Knowbots

   increased capacity of the Internet.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   It turns out that the technical committee called the
   Internet Engineering Task Force was very pre-occupied in
   the 1991-1994 period with the whole problem of
   accommodating exponential growth in the size of the
   Internet. They had a bunch of different options for re-
   placing the then-existing IP layer with something that
   could support a larger address space. There were a lot of
   arguments about how soon they would run out of addresses
   and a lot of uncertainty about how much functionality to
   add on while solving the primary growth problem. Some folks
   thought the scaling problem was so critical that it should
   take priority while others thought there was still some
   time and that new functionality would help motivate the
   massive effort needed to replace the then-current version 4
   IP.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   As it happens, they were able to achieve multiple
   objectives, as we now know. They found a way to increase
   the space for identifying logical end-points in the system
   as well increasing the address space needed to identify
   physical end-points. That gave them a hook on which to base
   the mobile, dynamic addressing capability that we now rely
   on so heavily in the Internet. According to the notes I
   have seen, they were also experimenting with new kinds of
   applications that required different kinds of service than
   the usual "best efforts" they were able to obtain from the
   conventional router systems.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   I found an absolutely hilarious "packet video clip" in one
   of the archives. It's a black-and-white, 6 frame per second
   shot of some guy taking off his coat, shirt and tie at one
   of the engineering committee meetings. His T-shirt says "IP
   on everything" which must have been some kind of slogan for
   Internet expansion back then. Right at the end, some big
   bearded guy comes up and stuffs some paper money in the
   other guy's waistband. Apparently, there are quite a few
   other archives of the early packet video squirreled away at
   the PHI. I can't believe how primitive all this stuff
   looks. I have attached a sample for you to enjoy. They
   didn't have TDV back then, so you can't move the point of
   view around the room or anything. You just have to watch
   the figures move jerkily across the screen.
]PRE]

   Jon,

[PRE[
   thanks for the pointer. I pulled up a lot of very useful
   material from PHI. You're right, they did manage to solve a
   lot of problems at once with the new IP. Once they got the
   bugs out of the prototype implementations, it spread very
   quickly from the transit service companies outward towards
   all the host computers in the system. I also discovered
   that they were doing research on primitive gigabit-per-
   second networks at that same general time. They had been
   relying on unbelievably slow transmission systems around
   100 megabits-per-second and below. Can you imagine how long
   it would take to send a typical 3DV image at those glacial
   speeds?
]PRE]

[PRE[
   According to the notes I found, a lot of the wide-area
   system was moved over to operate on top of something they
   called Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cell Switching or ATM for
   short. Towards the end of the decade, they managed to get
   end to end transfer rates on the order of a gigabyte per
   second which was fairly respectable, given the technology
   they had at the time. Of course, the telecommunications
   business had been turned totally upside down in the process
   of getting to that point.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   It used to be the case that broadcast and cable television,
   telephone and publishing were different businesses. In some
   countries, television and telephone were monopolies
   operated by the government or operated in the private
   sector with government regulation. That started changing
   drastically as the 1990s unfolded, especially in the United
   States where telephone companies bought cable companies,
   publishers owned various communication companies and it got
   to be very hard to figure out just what kind of company it

   was that should or could be regulated. There grew up an
   amazing number of competing ways to deliver information in
   digital form. The same company might offer a variety of
   information and communication services.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   With regard to the Internet, it was possible to reach it
   through mobile digital radio, satellite, conventional wire
   line access (quaintly called "dial-up") using Integrated
   Services Digital Networking, specially-designed modems,
   special data services on television cable, and new fiber-
   based services that eventually made it even into
   residential settings. All the bulletin board systems got
   connected to the Internet and surprised everyone, including
   themselves, when the linkage created a new kind of
   publishing environment in which authors took direct re-
   sponsibility for making their work accessible.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Interestingly, this didn't do away either with the need for
   traditional publishers, who filter and evaluate material
   prior to publication, nor for a continuing interest in
   paper and CD-ROM. As display technology got better and more
   portable, though, paper became much more of a specialty
   item. Most documents were published on-line or on high-
   density digital storage media.  The basic publishing
   process retained a heavy emphasis on editorial selection,
   but the mechanics shifted largely in the direction of the
   author - with help from experts in layout and
   accessibility. Of course, it helped to have a universal
   reference numbering plan which allowed authors to register
   documents in permanent archives. References could be made
   to these from any other on-line context and the documents
   retrieved readily, possiblyat some cost for copying rights.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   By the end of the decade, "multimedia" was no longer a
   buzz-word but a normal way of preparing and presenting
   information. One unexpected angle: multimedia had been
   thought to be confined to presentation in visual and
   audible forms for human consumption, but it turned out that
   including computers as senders and recipients of these
   messages allowed them to use the digital email medium as an
   enabling technology for deferred, inter-computer
   interaction.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Just based on what I have been reading, one of the toughest
   technical problems was finding good standards to represent
   all these different modalities. Copyright questions, which
   had been thought to be what they called "show-stoppers,"
   turned out to be susceptible to largely-established case

   law. Abusing access to digital information was impeded in
   large degree by wrapping publications in software shields,
   but in the end, abuses were still possible and abusers were
   prosecuted.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   On the policy side, there was a strong need to apply
   cryptography for authentication and for privacy. This was a
   big struggle for many governments, including ours here in
   France,  where there are very strong views and laws on this
   subject, but ultimately, the need for commonality on a
   global basis outweighed many of the considerations that
   inhibited the use of this valuable technology.
]PRE]

[PRE[
   Well, that takes us up to about 20 years ago, which still
   seems a far cry from our current state of technology. With
   over a billion computers in the system and most of the
   populations of information-intensive countries fully
   linked, some of the more technically-astute back at the
   turn of the millennium may have had some inkling of what
   was in store for the next two decades.

[PRE[
   This is really fascinating! I found some more material,
   thanks to the Internet Society, which summarizes the
   technical developments over the last 20 years. Apparently
   one of the key events was the development of all-optical
   transmission, switching and computing in a cost-effective
   way.  For a long time, this technology involved rather
   bulky equipment - some of the early 3DV clips from 2000-
   2005 showed rooms full of gear required to steer beams
   around. A very interesting combination of fiber optics and
   three-dimensional electro-optical integrated circuits
   collapsed a lot of this to sizes more like what we are
   accustomed to today. Using pico- and femto- molecular
   fabrication methods, it has been possible to build very
   compact, extremely high speed computing and communication

   I guess those guys at Xerox PARC who imagined that there
   might be hundreds of millions of computers in the world,
   hundreds or even thousands of them for each person, would
   be pleased to see how clear their vision was. The only
   really bad thing, as I see it, is that those guys who were
   trying to figure out how to deal with Internet expansion
   really blew it when they picked a measly 64 bit address
   space. I hear we are running really tight again. I wonder
   why they didn't have enough sense just to allocate at least
   1024 bits to make sure we'd have enough room for the
   obvious applications we can see we want, now?

Final Comments

[PRE[
   The letters end here, so we are left to speculate about many of the
   loose ends not tied up in this informal exchange. Obviously, our
   current struggles ultimately will be resolved and a very different,
   information-intensive world will evolve from the present. There are a
   great many policy, technical and economic questions that remain to be
   answered to guide our progress towards the environment described in
   part in these messages. It will be an interesting two or three
   decades ahead!
