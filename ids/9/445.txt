> adds a mozilla protocol for a view-rss scheme. This can then allow the user to do view-rss:http://www.peerfear.org/rss/index.rss and have the bonita handle the rendering of the channel.

>In an older NewsMonster attempt at an aggregator in 100% JavaScript under
>
Mozilla (it was called Bonita) I wrote a view-rss: protocol adapter for Mozilla.
>
It did exactly this. You put a URL such as
>
view-rss:http://www.peerfear.org/rss/
>
And then you could view it, subscribe to it, etc.
>
It could also handle the application/rss+xml media type correctly.
>
Expect this code to be merged into a future version of NewsMonster.
